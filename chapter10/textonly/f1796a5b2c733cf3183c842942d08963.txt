The fire, which has burned 1,200 hectares of bush, hit the coastal town of Tathra in New South Wales (NSW) on Sunday evening. 
There are no reports of residents missing or seriously injured, though a number of people have been treated for smoke inhalation, she said. 
"I walked to the beach for 5km with over 200 people to try to get away," a local, Simone Ward, told CNN. 
Ward, who later evacuated to the nearby coastal town of Bermagui, praised the community spirit in the Bega Valley, saying the quick thinking of the locals has been "phenomenal." 
"Everyone wants to help. Everyone who's seen those flames and that fire is so brave. It was so scary to be so close, you could see the flames and the explosions."
Chris Bowles, a tourist who is road-tripping around Australia in a van, posted on Instagram pictures of the flames rising above the trees and the houses in Tathra. 
Pretty crazy day today... after a 3 hour drive from Jindabyne we approached Tathra and saw a small fire burning in the bush on the way in. Within 2 hours of arriving the town had been evacuated and we made it safely to Bermagui. As you can see the fire came extremely close. We could see houses on fire as we drove away. Feel for the people of Tathra, hope everyone is safe #bushfire #tathra
