Saif Al-Islam further added that there were several witnesses willing to testify against Sarkozy, including Abdallah Snoussi, the former director of the Libyan intelligence services, and also Bashir Saleh Bashir, the former CEO of Libya Investment.
Saif Al-Islam branded Sarkozy as a war criminal and responsible for the spread of terrorism and illegal immigration in Libya and urged French President Emmanuel Macron to prosecute him for crimes committed against Libya.
