China on Friday announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on 128 U.S. products that include  pork, wine, fruit and steel.
Beijing said it will take measures against the U.S. goods in two stages if it cannot reach an agreement with Washington.
The U.S. goods, which had an import value of $3 billion in 2017, include wine, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol, and ginseng, the ministry said. Those products could see a 15 percent duty, while a 25 percent tariff could be imposed on U.S. pork and recycled aluminium goods, according to the statement.

The decision to target $3 billion in U.S. imports is significant, "but it's not a lot in terms of the total U.S.-China relationship," said economist Tony Nash, who is CEO and founder of data analytics firm Complete Intelligence.
Recent U.S. trade actions severely damage the multilateral trading system and disturb the international trading order, China's commerce ministry said, urging Washington to resolve its issues with Beijing to avoid harming the bilateral relationship.
