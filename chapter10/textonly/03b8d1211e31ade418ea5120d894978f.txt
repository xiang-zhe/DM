Oslo arts festival rejects Israeli choreographers, saying Israel uses culture to ‘whitewash’ occupation
As a result, wrote organizers Kristiane Nerdrum Bøgwald and Margrete Slettebø,  “We cannot with a clear conscience invite Israeli participants when we know that artists from the occupied Palestinian territories struggle with very restricted access to travel to international art venues and that they have little opportunity to communicate their art outside of the occupied territories.”
The choreographers called the rejection “reverse discrimination,” saying it holds artists accountable for the actions of their governments.
“Would you reject a Saudi artist for Saudi restrictions on women’s rights? Would you reject an American artist for the American policies regarding the ‘Muslim ban’ regulations?” they wrote in a letter, obtained by Ynet.
They also asked whether the ban would apply to Arab Israelis or Jewish-Israeli artists living abroad.
The organizers acknowledged receiving the Israeli reply but said that they could not address it until the festival was over because of their current heavy workload, Ynet reported.
