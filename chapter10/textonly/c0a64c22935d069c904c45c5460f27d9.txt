The UK government has caved to public pressure and given the OK for seriously ill Alfie Dingley to be given a prescription for medical cannabis. 
Alfie's medical condition causes him to have up to 150 seizures per month.   His parents recently took him to the Netherlands to receive treatment with cannabis oil and whilst receiving treatment Alfie seizures reduced to one per month.
Upon returning to the UK however, Alfie was no longer able to be prescribed cannabis and despite being given steroids, his condition was deteriorating.
Medical cannabis is currently a banned substance in the UK, But the government have paid attention to the level of public support for Alfie and agreed to his parents' request.
Alfie's mother met with Theresa May and other Government Ministers on Tuesday to make her case for her son to be prescribed the treatment.
Several high profile celebrities also came out in support of Alfie including Patrick Stewart and Richard Branson.
