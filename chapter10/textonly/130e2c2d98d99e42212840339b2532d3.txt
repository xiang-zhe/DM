Russia’s most advanced hypersonic missile system is expected to enter service no later than 2019, according to sources. 
A new hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV)—the Avangard (Vanguard in English) hypersonic boost-glide warhead—is expected to enter service with Russia’s Strategic Missile Force no later than 2019, according to a Russian defense industry source.
New composite materials have allowed for coping with the problem of keeping the winged vehicle under control during a prolonged flight amid plasma. In fact, while approaching the target it looks like a meteorite. A fireball. The temperature on its surface may reach 1,600-2,000 Celsius. Control of the winged vehicle remains reliable all the way.
The Russian Ministry of Defense has purportedly already signed a contract for the first batch of Avangard HGVs, while the commander of Russia’s Strategic Missile Force, General Sergei Karakayev, said the trials of the new weapon system has been completed.
The Avangard HGV will likely be mounted on Russia’s newest and most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the RS-28 Sarmat (NATO designation: SS-X-29 Satan 2). The Sarmat can be fitted with more than ten nuclear warheads. However, three to five HGVs per missile seem more realistic. The missile is expected to enter service by 2020, replacing the Soviet-era RS-36M Voyevod ICBMs. However, as with the majority of Russian defense programs, the project has encountered multiple delays and it appears unlikely that the Sarmat will enter service within the next two years.
