President Putin has said Russia has destroyed all its chemical weapons. In his first comments since the attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, he said that Britain’s claims about Moscow’s involvement were “nonsense”. He was speaking after celebrating his landslide victory in yesterday’s Presidential elections.
