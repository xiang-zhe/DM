Attorneys for Trump, Mueller hold face-to-face meeting to discuss potential interview topics: report 
It was after his legal team received the questions that Trump launched into a series of tweets in which he denied that his campaign coordinated with Moscow during the 2016 election and lambasted Mueller's investigation as unnecessary.
In one Saturday night tweet, Trump asserted that Mueller's investigation should never have been opened in the first place, because there was "no collusion" and "no crime."
The statement from Dowd was unusual for an attorney who has repeatedly insisted that Trump and the White House cooperate with Mueller's investigation, in hopes that it would come to a natural end.
But according to the Times, Trump's lawyers appear increasingly on edge, especially after Trump met earlier this month with attorney Emmet Flood. He reportedly discussed bringing Flood on to handle his interactions with Mueller's team. He also discussed Flood as a possible replacement for White House counsel Don McGahn, the Times reported.
Dowd and another one of Trump's lawyers, Jay Sekulow, were not aware of the meeting with Flood, and reportedly became concerned upon learning about it that they could be pushed aside.
