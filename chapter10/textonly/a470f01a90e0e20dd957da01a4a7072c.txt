Through these actions, McDonald's expects to prevent 150 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being released into the atmosphere by 2030. This is the equivalent of taking 32 million passenger cars off the road for an entire year or planting 3.8 billion trees and growing them for 10 years. The target will enable McDonald's to grow as a business without growing its emissions.
Building on the momentum of existing programs on forests, agriculture and energy efficiency, McDonald's and its partners will continue to identify practical solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and bring them to scale. In its commitment to transparency, McDonald's will expand its measurement systems, and annually communicate about progress, challenges and milestones.
We are currently working with our franchisees and supply chain partners to develop plans to address the largest segments of our carbon footprint to understand how we can prioritize action. However, we have already made progress in the Canadian market. For example:
Together with our franchisees, we have improved restaurant energy efficiency through innovations and programs. And, we'll continue to implement energy reduction measures such as LED lighting, Low Oil Volume Fryers and installation of high efficiency technologies. We will also be evaluating opportunities around renewable energy sources.
