No one company should have the power to manipulate the psychology of an entire country. We now know that Cambridge Analytica has done just that â€” not just in the United States, but also in the fragile political systems of the global south.
In these developing countries, there has been no word about sanctions or even a demand for answers from Cambridge Analytica. Besides, those who are supposed to penalize the offending companies would likely have the privilege of being the direct beneficiaries of its nefarious operations.
While Cambridge Analytica may face sanctions on both sides of the Atlantic, it will likely still get away with mischief and dangerous mind games in Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Regulators in those countries must step up to hold companies like this accountable or kick them out completely.
Kenyans must demand transparency and a full investigation. Sadly though, it is hard to imagine that Cambridge Analytica will ever be unwelcome here, when it helped elect the president twice.
