Protests took place in more than 150 towns and cities including Paris, where crowds swelled to about 200,000 people, and the western city of Nantes, where demonstrators clashed with police and at least one car was torched.
An estimated 10 percent of public-sector workers took part in the mostly peaceful protests. Striking rail workers and air traffic controllers forced those sectors to cancel hundreds of trains and plane trips on Thursday.
The airline is also dealing with its own private strike, which will take place Friday as its workers call for a six percent pay increase.
Ahead of those strikes Friday, the airline said it expected to operate 80 percent of those short-haul flights and 70 percent of those medium-haul flights -- in addition to 70 percent of its long-haul flights.
Polls indicate most French citizens back the striking state employees, but even more support the financial reforms Macron has proposed.
