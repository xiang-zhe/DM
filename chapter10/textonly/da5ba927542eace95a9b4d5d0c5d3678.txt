Money was also stolen from donations, wedding and baptism fees at churches and used to buy a lottery ticket shop, prosecutors say.
A Brazilian bishop has been arrested in connection with a corruption case involving around $600,000 (Â£423,000).
Police raided the home of Jose Ronaldo Ribeiro, the bishop of Formosa, who is accused of working with other Catholic clergymen to divert the money.
Prosecutors said the money was stolen from collection boxes, tithes, donations and wedding and baptism fees at churches in three cities near Brazil's capital - Formosa, Posse and Planaltina.
A spokeswoman for the Goias state prosecutor's office said other clergymen were arrested in Formosa but would not confirm their names.
Globo TV reported that along with Ribeiro, authorities arrested four priests and a vicar general in connection with the case.
Ribeiro was appointed to the diocese of Formosa, in the centre-west state of Goias, by Pope Francis in 2014.
The investigation began in 2015 after parishioners complained - but in an interview with local media two years ago, the bishop had denied any wrong-doing.
