Gemalto, a public company registered in the Netherlands, would not confirm that it has won the contract. “As the process is still ongoing and the terms of engagement are confidential, we cannot make any further comment on it at this stage,” it said.
Meanwhile, De La Rue is not going quietly. “We are deeply disappointed that the contract to manufacture the British passport will be awarded to a French company,” the company said in an email, adding, “This shows a serious lack of commitment to British business from the UK government.” On its site, De La Rue says it will consider appealing the decision. De La Rue makes passports for 40 countries and printed the new £5 note, as well as the £10 note, which features the face of Jane Austen.
