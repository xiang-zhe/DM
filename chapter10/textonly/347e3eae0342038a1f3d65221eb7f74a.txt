In 2013, the government began a program to get rid the rodents from the subantarctic island, which is a World Heritage Site that is home to dozens of unique and endangered species.
Antipodean wandering albatross, one of many endangered birds that were threatened by a mouse infestation on the Antipodes islands.
New Zealand, which owns the subantarctic archipelago, says its years-long effort to rid the rodents has finally paid off.
"This is huge news for conservation both in New Zealand and internationally," said conservation minister Eugenie Sage.
The newspaper writes: "The five-year project involved preparations and hut repairs, a helicopter bait-drop in June 2016, and post-eradication monitoring by just-returned teams that searched the island for a month and found no sign of mice."
"The subantarctic islands are remote, but the role they play in global conservation as the home for so many unique species can't be overstated," Department of Conservation project manager Stephen Horn said.
Since the 1990s, New Zealand has steadily made progress on clearing invasive species from its subantarctic islands â€“ including the removal of rats, mice, rabbits, cats goats and stoats (a small, carnivorous weasel).
In 2016, the country announced an ambitious plan to eliminate all such invasive species from New Zealand by 2050.
