A formal investigation was launched by organisers following a vitriolic social media spat that saw former participants accusing each other of inappropriate behavior.
In a confused flurry of social media posts this month, a group of ex-participants insinuated that other contestants had sought to enrich themselves through romantic relationships with corrupt businessmen and officials.
âGiven the events recently described on social media ... a decision has been made to begin an internal review to determine if anyone linked (to the pageant), during the course of their involvement, violated the values and ethics of the contest,â the Miss Venezuela Organization said in a statement.
Venezuelans are among the worldâs most successful beauty show contestants and have won global pageants including Miss Universe and Miss World more than a dozen times.
It was not immediately evident how this would affect the Miss Venezuela pageant, which is typically held toward the end of the year.
Grupo Cisneros referred questions to the Miss Venezuela Organization, which did not respond to a voice mail message seeking further comment.
