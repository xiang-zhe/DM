Train drivers, teachers, nurses and air traffic controllers take to the streets to protest against Macron’s changes
The strikes saw transport cancellations, some schools and creches closed, as well as limits on some services such as libraries and rubbish collection. Around 30% of Paris flights were cancelled and there was airport disruption in the south.
