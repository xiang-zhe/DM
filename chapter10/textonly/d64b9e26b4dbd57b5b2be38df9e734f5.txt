The revelation confirms long-held suspicions that the raid destroyed what Israel believed to be a nuclear reactor. Israeli officials made clear they intend this announcement to send a message to Iran.

This image, which is excerpted from a video released Wednesday, shows what the Israeli military says was a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor site near Deir al-Zor, photographed before and after an Israeli airstrike in September 2007.
After more than a decade of silence, the Israeli Defense Forces confirmed Wednesday that an Israeli airstrike destroyed a suspected nuclear reactor under construction in Syria in 2007.
"For two years, officials in the Military Intelligence Directorate had been monitoring the Syrian nuclear project," the Israeli military continued. "Their intelligence suggested that the facility would become active toward the end of 2007, which prompted the IDF to initiate an attack on the facility."
"Former President George W. Bush confirms in his memoir that the target of a 2007 Israeli airstrike was a Syrian nuclear reactor and suggests he quietly approved," the story noted, adding: "Bush said the raid showed the Jewish state would go it alone and revealed that Israel first asked the U.S. to bomb the site."
On Wednesday, when they broke their long silence, Israeli officials made clear they intended this announcement to warn another country in particular: Iran.
