Taiwan will face the "punishment of history" for any attempt at separatism, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday.
China has been infuriated by President Donald Trump's decision to sign legislation that encourages the U.S. to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa.

The United States does not have formal ties with Taiwan but is required by law to help it with self-defense and is the island's primary source of weapons.
In a speech at the end of China's annual session of parliament, Xi told the 3,000-odd delegates that China would push for the "peaceful reunification of the motherland" and work for more Taiwanese to enjoy the opportunities of China's development.
"It is a shared aspiration of all Chinese people and in their basic interests to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and realize China's complete reunification," Xi said.
"Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure and will meet with the people's condemnation and the punishment of history," he added, to loud applause.
"The Chinese people share a common belief that it is never allowed and it is absolutely impossible to separate any inch of our great country's territory from China."
