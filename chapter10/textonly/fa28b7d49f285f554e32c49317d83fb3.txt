By identifying which genes are key to the bugs’ survival, scientists hope to find ways to better control them
The secrets of the cockroach’s ability to thrive in some of the most disgusting places on Earth have been discovered in its DNA. 
Then there are yet more genes that ensure cockroaches reproduce at an impressive rate, while others underpin the ability of cockroach nymphs to regrow any limbs that are broken or nibbled off by predators. By identifying which genes are key to cockroach survival, scientists hope to find ways to better control them.
