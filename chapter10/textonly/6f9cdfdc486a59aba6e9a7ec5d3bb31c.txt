The Kremlin said on Thursday that the U.S. and Russia have a long way to go before the two countries reach any breakthrough in relations. 
"An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections," McCain said. 
Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to defend the call, saying Russia could help the U.S. in a variety of areas. 
I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......
.....They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but didn’t have the “smarts.” Obama and Clinton tried, but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!
