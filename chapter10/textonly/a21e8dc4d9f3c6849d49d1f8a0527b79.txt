However, the UK foreign secretary today accused Russia
    of concealing a "needle of truth in a haystack of
    lies."

  Speaking on Monday as he arrived in Brussels to meet with EU
  counterparts, the UK foreign secretary accused Vladimir Putin's
  government of "trying to conceal the needle of truth in a
  haystack of lies and obfuscation."


  Johnson is in Brussels to galvanize a joint EU condemnation of
  Russia as relations between London and Moscow continue to
  deteriorate.

Vladimir Chizhov, Russia's ambassador to the EU, told the
  BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Russia had "nothing to do"
  with the attack. However, Johnson this morning rejected Russian
  denials.

  "At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they
  say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been
  destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and
  all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have
  mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the
  United States, or even the United Kingdom."


  He added: "I think what people can see is that this is a classic
  Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a
  haystack of lies and obfuscation."


  "What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners
  today is that, 12 years after the assassination of Alexander
  Litvinenko in London, theyâre not fooling anybody anymore.


  "There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels
  that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive
  Russian behaviours.


  Johnson and other EU foreign ministers are expected to issue a
  joint statement later in the day.
