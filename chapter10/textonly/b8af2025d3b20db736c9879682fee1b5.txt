The body of a missing Australian woman has been found in a partially frozen lake at a Canadian ski resort almost four months after she disappeared.
Alison Raspa, originally from Perth, was reported missing from the Alpha Lake area near Whistler on 23 November.
The royal Canadian mounted police in Whistler said they received a report on Friday evening from bystanders who had found what they believed to be human remains in the lake.
“Whistler RCMP, Whistler Fire Rescue and the BC Coroners Service attended and confirmed found human remains at the north end of the partially frozen Alpha Lake,” it said. “The cause of death has not been confirmed, however, it does not appear suspicious.”
Raspa, 25, was last seen leaving a restaurant on the evening of 22 November in the ski resort town about 5km from the lake.
Raspa’s family has been informed and the case referred to the coroner. Whistler police urged anyone with information to contact them.
The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular assistance to the family. It was unable to comment further owing to privacy obligations.
