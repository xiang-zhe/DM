Iran was never found to have directly supported the September 11 hijack plot, while questions about Saudi's role linger.

The lawsuit, Dillaber, et al v Islamic Republic of Iran, et al, alleges that Iran and its Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS), along with Saudi Arabia, supported the 19 hijackers - 11 of whom were Saudi citizens.
The newly filed suit that names Iran and its MOIS as supporters of al-Qaeda's 9/11 hijacking plot details a long history of meetings between Iranian-linked fighters.
Iran and Hezbollah have maintained an antagonistic relationship with Saudi Arabia, largely over its support for the US and its military. Â 
Iran and Hezbollah also allegedly provided training to al-Qaeda fighters, though not ones directly linked to the September 11 attacks.
Iran was ordered to pay families and a group of insurers $1.8bn in 2016 in a default judgment on a similar case filed in 2011.
The US passed a law in 2016 called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), which limited immunity given to sovereign states for their participation in international acts of "terror".
The campaign included a tactic of misrepresenting legal consequences of passing the law. Firms employed by Saudi Arabia informed US military veterans they could be sued for their actions in foreign wars, which is not true.Â 
The Saudi-employed lobbying firms flew veterans to Washington DC so they could visit legislators to argue against the bill.
Plaintiffs in the main lawsuit against Saudi Arabia have filed documents supporting the consolidation of the cases, court documents show.
