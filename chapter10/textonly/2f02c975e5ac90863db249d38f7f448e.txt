Volatility may rule the day as regulatory uncertainty divides analysts on what will come next for cryptocurrency, but according to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, 10 years from now—or less—bitcoin is likely to emerge as the world’s only currency.
“The world ultimately will have a single currency, the internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be bitcoin,” Dorsey told The Times.
And while Dorsey says that bitcoin “does not have the capabilities right now to become an effective currency”, he defines “ultimately” as “probably over ten years, but it could go faster”.
Bitcoin may be struggling with scaling and approachability issues that are slowing it down, but “as more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable”.
With talk on Wall Street already comparing Square to “Amazon in the early days,” Dorsey has every reason to endorse bitcoin with a renewed vigor.
Square is taking the mobile payments segment by storm—so far--so many will be forgiven for buying into the bitcoin endorsement.
