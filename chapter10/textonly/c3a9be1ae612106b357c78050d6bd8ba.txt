"We do not want them to investigate, we do not want information from them, we do not want anything from them because we know exactly that they, the Hamas movement, were the ones who committed this incident," Abbas said at a meeting of the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah late on Monday.Â 
Shortly after the attack, Hamas said it was launching an investigation to uncover who was behind the blast and deflected the PA's comments blaming the Gaza-based group for the incident.Â 
Speaking during Monday's meeting, Abbas said that if the "assassination attempt" had succeeded, the development would have opened the door for a bloody civil war.Â 
"We are shocked by the tense stance that Abbas has taken. This position burns bridges and strengthens division and strikes the unity of our people," Hamas said in a press release.Â 
"In light of all this, Hamas calls for general elections, including presidential, parliamentary and national council elections, so that the Palestinian people can choose their leadership."
The attack and subsequent statements by both sides mark a serious deterioration in relations between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, the semi-autonomous body that governs the occupied West Bank.Â 
But the deal was never fully implemented due to differences within the two political factions, which are the largest in Palestinian politics.Â 
Ninety-nine years since Balfour's "promise", Palestinians insist that their rights in Palestine cannot be dismissed.
