The tourists, a 65-year-old woman and a 79-year-old man, were visiting from Hawaii on Wednesday afternoon when the Airbus H120 crashed into a remote coral-viewing pontoon, killing them and injuring the others on board, Queensland police said.


The remaining passengers, a 34-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman from Colorado, and the pilot were taken to the Australian mainland to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.


"The four passengers are from the U.S.A. and are known to each other," Queensland State Police Inspector Ian Haughton said Thursday. "An independent, transparent and robust investigation is currently underway." That inquiry will involve the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.


Haughton could not provide any additional details about the crash or the surviving passengers, but he said the pilot, 35, had pulled one of the dead from the wreckage, while a witness on the scene performed CPR on others.


The helicopter operator, Whitsunday Air Services, said it is "devastated by this accident and our thoughts and condolences are with the passengers and their families."


The company said it would suspend air-service operations "until a full review of the accident is undertaken."
