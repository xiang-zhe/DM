Israel Police Commisioner Roni Alscheich says state’s witness Miki Ganor has been a valuable asset in a case involving the suspected illicit purchase of naval vessels from a German shipbuilder.
							
“He provided the goods and did so very well,” Alsheich tells the Makor Rishon newspaper regarding Ganor in an interview published Thursday.
Alsheich also says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not a suspect in the case. A number of the prime minister’s associates have been implicated in the case, including his personal lawyer and former top negotiator.
Ganor was the former local representative of ThyssenKrupp and was suspected of giving bribes in connection to the purchase of submarines from the German company. He turned state’s witness in the case in July.

MOSCOW â The Kremlin denounces British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson’s statement comparing the World Cup in Russia to the Olympics hosted by Nazi Germany as “utterly disgusting.”
The tough response marks an escalating war of words between Moscow and London over the poisoning in southwestern England of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent. Britain blamed the attack on Russia, which fiercely denied the accusations.
Johnson agreed Wednesday with a Labour lawmaker who likened the soccer World Cup hosted by Russia this summer to Adolf Hitler’s use of the 1936 Olympics as propaganda for his regime.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov describes it Thursday as “the utterly disgusting statement which is unworthy of a foreign minister of any country.” He calls Johnson’s words “insulting and unacceptable.”

The Haifa District Court sentences an Arab Israeli man to 28 months in prison for trying to join the Islamic State terror group’s affiliate in the Sinai Peninsula.
The verdict says Mohammed ben Ahmed Azzam, a 24-year-old resident of Kafr Manda in northern Israel, became interested in IS in 2015 and decided to join the terror group in 2016 “in order to help the organization’s members fight the State of Israel and liberate Jerusalem and the Al-Asqa Mosque from it.”
Azzam’s sentence was agreed upon as part of a plea deal with prosecutors and will include time served since his arrest in June 2017.
ANKARA, Turkey — Three Turkish soldiers are killed Thursday clearing improvised explosive devices in the Syrian region of Afrin after the capture of Afrin city over the weekend, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim sys.
“We have three martyrs today. They were martyred while clearing IEDs,” Yildirim says in a televised speech in Ankara. Three more soldiers are injured, the Turkish army adds.

Israel’s Justice Ministry has informed Facebook that it is opening an “administrative investigation” into the company following reports of the transfer of personal information from Facebook to data-mining firm Cambridge Analytics “and the possibility of additional violations of Israelis’ personal information,” the ministry says.
Cambridge Analytica been under fire since The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that it used data inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections, including the 2016 US presidential election. Among that information were users’ likes.
Additionally, a report by UK’s Channel 4 revealed hidden camera footage in which Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix describes using Israeli “intelligence gathering” to get information about voters.
“According to privacy laws, personal information may only be used for the purpose it was given over for and may be transferred to another party only with consent,” a statement from the Justice Ministry’s Privacy Protection Authority statement says.
“The Authority will therefore investigate whether personal information of Israeli users has been illegally used in a manner that violates their right to privacy and violates the laws of privacy protection in Israel,” the statement adds.
Yesterday, breaking five days of silence, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized for the “major breach of trust,” admitted mistakes and outlined steps to protect user data.
A spokesperson for the Justice Ministry confirms to the Times of Israel that the probe is not currently being treated as a criminal investigation, but says it may become one “at a later date.”
The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo says the monkey was born two weeks ago to mom Bilbi and dad Zohar. The yet unnamed monkey was seen Thursday clinging to its mother’s back.
Golden lion tamarins are among the rarest animals in the world, according to the World Wildlife Fund. It is listed as endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
The Jerusalem zoo says the primate was under threat of extinction in the 1980s when less than 100 were found in its native Brazil. But a breeding program in zoos around the world halted its decline. Today, there are hundreds of golden lion tamarins in the wild and in zoos worldwide.
WASHINGTON — The United States imposes sanctions on a Frenchman it accuses of helping the Islamic State terror group deploy chemical weapons on the Syrian battlefield.
A statement from the State Department identifies the suspect as Joe Asperman and says he had been listed as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist.”
“French national Joe Asperman is a senior chemical weapons expert for ISIS,” the statement says. “Asperman oversaw chemical operations production within Syria for ISIS and the deployment of these chemical weapons at the battlefront.”
Although hundreds of French fighters are thought to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with jihadist groups like the Islamic State, Asperman’s name has not previously been reported.
The US Treasury’s list of sanctioned terrorists says he is believed to have been born in the Cannes region on France’s southern, Mediterranean coast between 1986 and 1988.
Along with Bashar Assad’s Damascus regime, the Islamic State terror group has also been accused of deploying chemical attacks in Syria, where it is one of the factions in the long-running civil war.
Along with Asperman, the State Department also designates the Katibat al-Imam al-Bukhari, an armed group it describes as an Al Qaeda ally and “the largest Uzbek fighting force in Syria.”

An army spokesman describes the evacuation of Beit Hamachpela as âpeaceful,â with the residents agreeing to clear the building adjacent to the Tomb of the Patriarchs holy site despite their vehement opposition to the order.
On March 12, the High Court of Justice ruled that the apartment complex had to be cleared of its 15 Israeli families, who were unable to prove that their purchase of the structure was legal.

WARSAW, Poland — The Polish attorney general’s office describes as partly unconstitutional the Holocaust law meant to defend Poland’s image abroad that instead drew criticism from Israel, Ukraine and the United States.
The statement published Thursday comes as a surprise, as Prosecutor General Zbigniew Ziobro is also the head of the justice ministry that came up with the controversial law.
The legislation, which came into force earlier this month, imposes fines or up to three years in jail on anyone who ascribes “responsibility or co-responsibility to the Polish nation or state for crimes committed by the German Third Reich.”
The attorney general’s office publishes its statement on the website of the Constitutional Court, which was tasked by the president with checking whether the law was constitutional.
The office says that penalizing acts committed abroad independently of the laws in place there was against the Constitution, which opposes “excessive interference.”
It adds that the law is “dysfunctional,” could have “opposite results than those intended” and could “undermine the Polish state’s authority.”
Ultra-Orthodox protesters block Route 4 in both directions during anti-draft protest in central Israel, police say.

The leaders of a key House committee are calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining company.
Representatives Greg Walden of Oregon and Frank Pallone of New Jersey say in a statement the “latest revelations regarding Facebook’s use and security of user data raises many serious consumer protection concerns.” They say their staffs received a briefing yesterday from Facebook officials that left many questions unanswered.
Walden is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Pallone is the panel’s top ranking Democrat.
Their statement comes a day after Zuckerberg told CNN that he would be “happy” to testify before Congress.
The lawmakers say they’ll work with Facebook and Zuckerberg to set a date and time “in the near future.”
WARSAW, Poland — Polish victims of World War II should be able to claim 440 billion euros ($543 billion) from Germany in World War II damages, the head of a parliamentary commission says Thursday.
Arkadiusz Mularczyk of the nationalist ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) bases the figure, which the German government rejects, on a 1990 study which found that “there were 13.32 million direct victims of Nazi Germany in Poland.
That figure takes into account deportees, labor and concentration camp prisoners, civilians left maimed during that period, widows, orphans, and those who suffered from illnesses which broke out under Nazi occupation and during the conflict.
“That was the sum in 1990. If we revalue taking into account dollar purchasing power in 2017 we get 1.984 trillion zloty, or $543 billion,” the PAP news agency quotes Mularczyk as saying.
The issue of German reparations had long been regarded as closed — but PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski revived the topic last year.
Last year, then German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the issue had already been settled in August 1953 when Poland’s then communist administration said it renounced any right to war reparations.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a gathering of Likud activists in Tel Aviv to mark the upcoming Passover holiday.
“The Likud is the strongest party in Israel. Together we are leading the state and together we will continue to lead it for many years,” he says.
Netanyahu says the party will win more than the 30 Knesset seats it currently has in the next elections.
Netanyahu takes aim at the media and unnamed opponents, claiming corruption investigations involving him are a “witch hunt.”
“Because it impossible to defeat us by democratic means, there are those who assert unceasing and thuggish pressure on law enforcement in order to topple us by other means,” says Netanyanhu.
NEW YORK â CNN chief Jeff Zucker sharply attacks the network’s rivals at Fox News Channel on Thursday, saying that it has become a propaganda machine that is “doing an incredible disservice to the country.”
Zucker is speaking at the Financial Times Future of News conference two days after a former Fox military analyst quit, claiming he was ashamed at the way the network’s opinion hosts were backing President Donald Trump. Zucker says that analyst, Ralph Peters, voiced what a lot of people have been thinking about Fox in the post-Roger Ailes era.
“What has happened to that network in the last 18 months, especially the last year, is that it has just turned itself into state-run TV,” Zucker says. “TASS has nothing on them,” he says in reference to the Russian news agency.
Zucker says that Fox has “a handful of good journalists but they get lost in the propaganda machine.”
