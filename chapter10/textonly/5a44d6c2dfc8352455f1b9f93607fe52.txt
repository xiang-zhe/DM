Attorneys for Trump, Mueller hold face-to-face meeting to discuss potential interview topics: report 
"It's been honestly a surreal week," Kogan said in the email. "I've been asked quite seriously by reporters from the NY Times and the Guardian if I am a Russian spy. I really tried to explain that one seems just silly. If I am Russian spy, I am the world's dumbest spy."
The firm is under intense scrutiny after The New York Times reported on Saturday that it had extracted private information of more than 50 million people from Facebook, and then used the data to help the Trump campaign through influencing voter behavior. 
Facebook said that Kogan told the company it was gathering information for academic purposes, and that he violated Facebook policy by giving the data to Cambridge Analytica. 
"We never claimed during the project that it was for academic research. In fact, we did our absolute best not to have the project have any entanglements with the University," Kogan wrote in the email. 
Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday it deleted the information Kogan had provided after it became known he did not follow Facebook's policies.
