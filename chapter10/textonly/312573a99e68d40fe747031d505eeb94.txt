However, new analysis reveals a package of 10 well-designed policies can promote efficiency and renewable energy, helping to achieve Poland’s energy security goals, while lowering emissions and saving thousands of lives per year.
The Sośnica coal mine in Gliwice began operations in 1917. Polish mines suffer from years of under-investment and struggle to achieve profitability.
Electricity and industry are responsible for the lion’s share of emissions in Poland, making up 38 and 41% of the country’s emissions, respectively. Even without ambitious, new policy, the power sector is expected to decarbonize somewhat as old, dirty coal plants are replaced by newer coal and gas plants, and as solar gains a foothold.
By 2050, about half of Poland’s total emissions are likely to come from the industrial sector, and the power sector will be responsible for about a quarter of the country’s total emissions. Buildings and transportation are about equal, and district heating emits about half as much as either one of these sectors, rounding out the rest of Poland’s emissions.
