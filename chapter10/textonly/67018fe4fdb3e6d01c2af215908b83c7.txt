Damning Russian ‘election rigging’ pictures show voters casting Putin ballots at more than one polling station
The claims come after Putin comfortably extended his rule of Russia for another six years  winning 76.67 per cent of the vote - his highest score ever
PHOTOS seem show Russian state workers “voting multiple times” in the country’s presidential election.
The images come after Vladimir Putin’s record victory has already been soured by claims the ballots were rigged in his favour.
Many of those caught on camera turned up to the polling stations in groups and in state-run minibuses.
One woman caught voting at least THREE TIMES was identified as a hospital deputy director of health and safety.
But when shown these pictures, election commission member Leila Koichuyeva said: “They could be twins.”
Respected news agency Reuters was able to speak to seven of 17 people photographed casting multiple votes.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said they would only take the images seriously if there was further evidence.
In all 12 polling stations, the turnout declared by election officials exceeded a tally kept by Reuters of how many people voted.
In one case in Simferopol the difference between the two figures was significant: 528 votes, or 66 percent of the votes cast.
The journalists also uncovered a loophole in the registration system which allows people to vote in more than one location.
When told she had been photographed with a voting slip in her hand at the second location she said: “Is it alright if I don’t reply?”
The claims come after Putin comfortably extended his rule of Russia for another six years winning 76.67 per cent of the vote.
The Central Election Commission said communist Pavel Grudinin came in a distant second with 11.78 per cent.
