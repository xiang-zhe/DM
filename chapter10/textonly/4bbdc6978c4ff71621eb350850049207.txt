More than 71,000 hectares (177,000 acres) of protected countryside, including national park land, in the south-east of England are at risk from a new wave of oil drilling, environmental campaigners have warned.
A mapping analysis by the group found that around 71,000 hectares of protected areas overlap with oil and gas exploration licenses awarded by the government for the south-east, across an area stretching from the Surrey Hills in the east to the Isle of Wight to the west. 
The warning comes as campaigners in Surrey prepare to deliver a petition with more than 100,000 signatures against plans for an oil well at Holmwood, south of Dorking.
The plans do not involve fracking, but in some cases will use a technique known as acidisation, where diluted hydrochloric acid is put down a well to dissolve limestone, releasing the oil trapped within, as well as oil within adjacent shale formations.
UKOG’s licences for the Horse Hill work included protected areas known as sites of special scientific interest, but the company said it had no plans to drill in protected areas and was fully aware of their sensitivity.
“Rather than importing essential resources from potentially untrustworthy foreign sources, we believe that this country’s energy security is an issue of paramount importance and that indigenous oil has a key role to play in this regard,” the company said.
Hugh Mackay, the company’s chief executive, said the well was similar to a dozen other discoveries made in the Weald over the last three decades. “There’s no new technology here, it’s a typical Weald basin oil prospect.”
The petition’s organiser, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian: “We are deeply concerned for the pollution risks this drilling proposal presents to our water supply.”
