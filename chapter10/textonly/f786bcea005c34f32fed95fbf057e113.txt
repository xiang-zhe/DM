Siembra Minera, created in February 2016, is one of the three mixed companies built in the Mining Arc, after the Government signed a memorandum of understanding, together with another 150 companies from 35 countries.
Cano estimates that production, between three and 18 years, will reach 1.2 million ounces of gold annually, "which will make the company one of the most profitable in the world" and added that 55 percent will be used for social investment in the country.
In addition, the minister indicated that the joint venture has some 1,480 tons of gold and 2.5 million tons of copper, which reaffirms the economic value of the Mining Arc.
The Venezuelan government will implement a sanitation plan with production to protect the environment and ensure ecological balance, "the recovery of spoiled soils and bodies of water affected after years of capitalist mining."
The Minister for Communication and Information, Jorge Rodr√≠guez, reiterated on Tuesday that the Orinoco Mining Arc has more than eight thousand tons of gold, without adding other minerals.
The official said that the certified mine will produce double what has been achieved so far, and the economic activity will begin once the Government and the Canadian company consolidate the agreements to move forward.
