Twelve journalists were murdered in the country last year, putting it on a par with Syria. Reporters Without Borders ranked Mexico at 147 out of 180 countries on its 2017 World Press Freedom Index. 
But Vargas Llosa suggested the deaths were a sign that press freedom was improving. “The fact that more than 100 journalists were murdered is, in grand part, to be blamed on the freedom of the press today, which allows journalists to say things that were not permitted previously. Narcotics trafficking plays an absolutely central part in all of this,” he said.
Vargas Llosa was also criticised for suggesting that drug traffickers are the main source of violence against Mexico’s press. Organised crime groups have targeted many journalists, but press freedom advocates say public officials often pose more problems for the media than narcotics traffickers. 
Vargas Llosa’s comments came in an interview with the online radio host Carmen Aristegui, who has herself been forced off air twice after running afoul of the authorities.
Last month, he admonished Mexicans not to commit “democratic suicide” by voting for the leftwing populist – and current frontrunner – Andrés Manuel López Obrador in the country’s 1 July presidential election.
López Obrador – who has tapped a vein of deep discontent over corruption, violence and disgust with the political class – currently leads polls by double digits. 
But Vargas Llosa has compared him to Hugo Chávez and warned that Mexico risks the same ruin as Venezuela.
