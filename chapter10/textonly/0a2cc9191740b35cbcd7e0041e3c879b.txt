Report: CEO of Trump Campaign Data Firm Told Staff to Use Hacked Emails to Influence Nigerian Election
caught on tape boasting about their willingness to use bribes, blackmail, and secretly distributed propaganda to win elections
The Guardian and Observer has been told the Israelis brought a laptop from their office in Tel Aviv and handed employees a USB stick containing what they believed were hacked personal emails.
Sources said Nix, who was suspended on Tuesday, and other senior directors told staff to search for incriminating material that could be used to damage opposition candidates, including Buhari. … One member of the campaign team told the Guardian and Observer that the material they believed had been hacked included Buhari’s medical records. “I’m 99% sure of that. Or if they didn’t have his medical records they at least had emails that referred to what was going on.”

        
          The Guardian’s piece does not make clear whether any employees followed Nix’s instructions; Jonathan ultimately lost his race. Cambridge Analytica’s parent company “denied taking possession of or using hacked or stolen personal information,” the Guardian writes.
