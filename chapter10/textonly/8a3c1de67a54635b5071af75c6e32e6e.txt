Visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that Japan's deployment of a U.S. land-based missile defense system could impede negotiations on the return of Russian-held islands off northern Japan.
âI want to confirm that security issues concerning this region (the Russian Far East) are of vital interest to us,â Lavrov said in a joint news conference March 21 with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono following their bilateral talks in Tokyo.
He was referring to an area that encompasses the Northern Territories, a group of islands off eastern Hokkaido which are occupied by Russia but claimed by Japan.
The meeting, which followed Vladimir Putin's victory March 18 in securing a fourth term as president, lasted four hours and 10 minutes, including a luncheon.
Much of the time was spent discussing topics related to security, according to high-ranking officials of the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
During the news conference, Lavrov referred to Japanâs plan to introduce the U.S. Aegis Ashore land-based missile defense system.
âIf the United States deploys the missile defense system in the Asian region, it will become an issue that is directly related to Russiaâs security,â he said.
Implicit in the remark was Russia's intention to continue raising the issue in negotiations with Japan.
Kono, attempting to address Russia's concerns, reached an agreement with Lavrov to hold bilateral meetings of vice foreign ministers or other high-ranking officials twice in the period from April to May to discuss security matters.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Putin are scheduled to hold a bilateral summit in St. Petersburg in late May.
In the lead-up to that meeting, Kono and Lavrov confirmed that the two countries will hold intensive discussions on joint economic activities in the Northern Territories and visits by former islanders by air to tend family graves.
