	President Trump wanted to add a little star power to his legal team, but was shot down Tuesday by the attorney his legal team had in mind.


	The White House contacted conservative lawyer Theodore Olson, the solicitor general under President George W. Bush, according to the Washington Post.


	But the 77-year-old “legal superstar,” a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, will not be bringing his courtroom expertise to the Trump team.


	Trump has reportedly been looking to restructure his legal team as special counsel Robert Mueller prepares to question the President about Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice.


	Trump spent the weekend railing against Mueller’s probe as his attorney John Dowd released a statement calling for an end to the federal investigation.
President Trump has reportedly been looking to restructure his legal team as special counsel Robert Mueller prepares to question him.


	The President tweeted that the team assembled by Mueller is biased and that “the Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.”


	Asked to explain the President’s online outbursts, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump is just frustrated.


	“Clearly we have not been shy about the fact that there’s frustration of this process,” she said. “We would like it to end quickly and soon. The President has contended since day one and will continue to do so that there was absolutely no collusion between his campaign and any outside force or country.”


	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that Mueller is a “thoroughly credible individual”


	“I don’t think Bob Mueller is going anywhere,” McConnell told reporters. “The President’s lawyers obviously agree that he ought to be allowed to finish the job.”
