The son of the deposed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has welcomed the detention of Nicolas Sarkozy and repeated his offer to provide evidence that the former French president’s 2007 election campaign was funded illicitly by the Libyan government.
In a series of messages sent by WhatsApp, Gaddafi’s son claimed he had witnessed the first portion of money being delivered in Tripoli to Sarkozy’s former chief-of-staff Claude Guéant.
He added that he was one of several witnesses who were ready to testify – including Abdallah Snoussi, ex-director of the Libyan intelligence services, and Bashir Salah, former chief executive of Libya Investment.
Snoussi has a recording of the first meeting between Sarkozy and Gaddafi in Tripoli before his 2007 election campaign, al-Islam claims. He alleges that both men made a second delivery of cash to Paris.
Takieddine has been quoted by a Lebanese newspaper as saying he acted as an intermediary between France and Libya when Sarkozy was interior minister, before his presidential bid. Five months after his election, Gaddafi came to Paris on his first state visit to a Western country in decades.
However, by 2011 the then French president had turned against the Libyan leader. France was at the forefront of NATO-led airstrikes against Gaddafi’s forces that helped rebel fighters overthrow the dictator and his regime.
It was around this time that Gaddafi’s son, Saif al-Islam, made his comments to Euronews as he expressed outrage at France’s recognition of the rebel groups’ interim government set up in Benghazi.
