Father Edward Staniek, a parish priest in the southern city of Krakow, had apparently been angered by the popeâs call for Catholics to take in Muslim refugees because it was their Christian duty.
In a sermon delivered last month Father Staniek said: âI pray for the Pope in his wisdom to open his heart to the Holy Spirit, but if he does not, I pray for his quick departure to his Fatherâs house. I can always ask God for a happy death for him because a happy death is a great grace.â
Later in the sermon he said there is âno dialogueâ with Muslims, and that the âdoors to the diocese and parish are open only to believers in Jesus Christ.â
The popeâs call for Catholicâs to demonstrate charity towards Muslim refugees has struggled to make headway in Poland, and Central Europe as a whole.
