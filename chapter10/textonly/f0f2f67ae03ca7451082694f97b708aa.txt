The Indian external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj, told parliament that tests had shown a match with the construction workers, who disappeared in June 2014 when the city fell to Isis.
Swaraj said ID cards, long hair and the kara bracelets traditionally worn by Sikh men were recovered from the grave of the workers, who mostly hailed from Punjab state.
The bodies were found near Badush, a village about six miles from the construction site where the men were snatched. Isis has been accused of killing at least 500 inmates from a prison in the same area in June 2014.
He claimed to have only been grazed by a bullet and to have escaped to the Kurdish-controlled city of Erbil. He also said the workers had been in phone contact with their families and the Indian embassy in Baghdad in the days before their execution. 
In a press conference later on Tuesday, she defended the delay in confirming the men’s deaths despite mounting evidence they had been executed. “It would have been a sin had we handed over anybody’s body claiming it to be those of our people, just for the sake of closing files,” she said.
The Punjab chief minister, Amarinder Singh, tweeted: “Shattered at the heart-wrenching news ... that the 39 Indians missing in Iraq, most of whom were Punjabis, are dead.
