“All transactions related to, provision of financing for, and other dealings in, by a United States person or within the United States, any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token, that was issued by, for, or on behalf of the Government of Venezuela on or after January 9, 2018, are prohibited as of the effective date of this order.”
This move by the US President is the first major national decision by the US to ban a cryptocurrency. The executive order, which allows the president to act unilaterally, specifically mentions cryptocurrencies that are “by, for, and on behalf” of the “Government of Venezuela” so it does not appear to be an immediate threat to other cryptocurrencies.
For the time being, the Petro seems to only serve the interest of the Venezuelan government rather than the citizens of the country who use Bolivars, USD, and other cryptocurrencies. Thus the citizens of Venezuela should not suffer much from this ban since Venezuelans are utilizing other cryptocurrencies to escape the terrible policies of their government.
