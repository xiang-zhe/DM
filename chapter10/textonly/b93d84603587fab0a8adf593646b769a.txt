	A Chinese space station is going to fall uncontrolled out of space, and now, trackers know when. Kind of.


	Marco Langbroek, an archaeologist who has made a secondary career out of tracking satellites, predicted today (March 20) that the space station will re-enter the atmosphere within three days of March 31. That closely matches the ESA's latest forecast, issued Saturday (March 17), that the re-entry will occur between March 30 and April 6.


	Knowing when the re-entry will occur is only half the story, though. The space station is moving too fast and is too uncontrolled for trackers to peg where it will enter the atmosphere any more specifically than somewhere between 43 degrees north latitude and 43 degrees south latitude. That's an area that includes Boston and Beijing, but also Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Brisbane, Australia. (Not to mention a whole lot of ocean.) Most of the populated world falls within the possible re-entry zone.


	Whatever bits of it don't break up in the atmosphere are vanishingly unlikely to hurt anyone at all — much less you or anyone you know — given the sheer vastness of unoccupied space on the planet.
