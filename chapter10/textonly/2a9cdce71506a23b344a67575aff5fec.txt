The parent company of Cambridge Analytica, the political research company at the center of a massive Facebook data scandal, reportedly offered a $1.4 million bribe to win an election for a client.
SCL Group reportedly entrapped the leader of St. Kitts and Nevis' opposition party with a $1.4 million (£1 million) bribe to secure a win for their client.
The company has been caught on tape offering to bribe politicians and boasting about helping Donald Trump win the 2016 election.
 The Times also revealed that ousted Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix used racial slurs to describe black clients in internal emails. 
 Cambridge Analytica's board said Nix's comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations "do not represent the values or operations of the firm." 
 Cambridge Analytica — founded by Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, and Robert Mercer, a top GOP donor who has sunk at least $15 million into the company — used the private data to predict the behavior of individual American voters. 
 Trump's campaign reportedly paid Cambridge Analytica more than $5 million for its services from September 2016.
