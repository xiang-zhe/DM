The bylaw, passed Monday night in the Montreal suburb of Hampstead, bans smoking in all public places, in what is believed to be a first in Canada. 
MONTREAL — A Montreal suburb has adopted a bylaw that bans all smoking in public places, in what is believed to be a first in Canada.
The Canadian Cancer Society said earlier this month that Hampstead, Que., would become the first municipality in the country to ban smoking in public if the bylaw were enacted.
Mayor William Steinberg has said the law would protect people’s health and send a strong anti-smoking message.
