The prime suspec­t remain­s at large as police report­edly make attemp­ts to save him from an inquir­y 
While the Punjab police’s uniforms and the appearance of police stations may have changed, their standards of ethics and treatment of the commoners have not.
The FIR no 258/18 was registered under Section 377 (unnatural offences) of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
According to the report, the accused assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Muhammad Imran was the culprit behind the assault and filmed the crime. He also threatened the boy that he will shoot him dead in a fake encounter.
The assault took place a week ago at Ghousia colony when police personnel lured the victim to the police station on a false pretext. He was then assaulted by personnel Shafaqat while officer Imran filmed the whole incident.
The personnel then locked up the boy in the police station on the fake charges of stealing motorcycles. He was threatened of dire consequences if he told anyone about what had happened to him.
Eventually, the boy’s relatives arrived at the police station after which he was released. He instantly told his father about his ordeal. However, SHO of Shera Kot refused to take action against his subordinate Imran.
The ASI was first transferred and then, instead of being sent behind bars, is being kept in the SHO’s retiring room with protocol.
Police also reportedly assisted Shafaqat in fleeing from the scene and he is still at large. Furthermore, another accused personnel Falak Sher was not named in the case.
The report quoted sources as saying that unlawful gatherings have previously been taking place at the said torture cell run by the ASI.
