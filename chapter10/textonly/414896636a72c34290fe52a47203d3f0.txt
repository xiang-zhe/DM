That said, the 76-year-old conservative politician has denied the charges against him, with Lee rejecting the investigation as “political revenge” mounted by the current administration in office, headed by liberal President Moon Jae-in.
“Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, who seized power through a 1979 military coup, were imprisoned for mutiny and corruption in 1995. They were released through a presidential pardon in 1997.
“Late President Roh Moo-hyun was also investigated for alleged corruption involving his family in 2009 while Lee was in office. He killed himself while the probe was ongoing in May of that year.”
“Other charges include abuse of power, breach of trust, illegally stashing presidential documents and a violation of election law,” Yonhap explains.
Chang Je-won, spokesperson for the Liberty Korea Party, the conservative opposition to Moon’s government, was on hand at Lee’s residence to watch the ex-president being taken away. And he released a statement expressing his party’s regret at the development.
“Should living as a former president in this country be this difficult?” he said. “I hope former President Lee will be the last victim of a political revenge.”
Prosecutors have 20 days to hold Lee at the Seoul Eastern Detention Center, while they decide whether to slap him with formal charges.
