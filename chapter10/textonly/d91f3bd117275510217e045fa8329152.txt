The last male northern white rhinoceros has died, leaving only two females with which conservationists hope to save the species from extinction.
“He was a gentle giant, his personality was just amazing and given his size, a lot of people were afraid of him. But there was nothing mean about him,” said Elodie Sampere, a representative for Ol Pejeta.
The hope for continuing the species lies in artificially inseminating either Najin or her daughter, Fatu.
