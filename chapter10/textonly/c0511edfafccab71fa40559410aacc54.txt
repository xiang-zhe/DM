AROUND 200 people - including school children - are reported to have been poisoned in a chemical leak just outside Moscow.
More than 20 kids have been hospitalised after a possible hydrogen sulphide leak at the nearby Yadrovo dump, Russia's TASS news agency reported.

Earlier this month, riot police were called in to disperse protesters from Volokolamsk who complained their town was being polluted by noxious gases.
Demonstrators blocked a road leading to the Yadrovo landfill on March 8 and prevented rubbish trucks from entering the town.
That protest came just one day after local officials announced a state of emergency after the level of hydrogen sulphide in the air was recorded at more than twice the normal level.
They said it was caused by a leak at the local landfill but the region's environment minister, Aleksandr Kogan, is reported to have said it wasn't harmful to locals.
