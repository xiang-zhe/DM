ABC15 spoke with an attorney to find out what kind of standard self-driving Uber's should be held to following the deadly pedestrian crash in Tempe.
Tempe police have released dash cam video from the deadly Uber crash that killed a pedestrian Sunday night.
Tempe police on Wednesday released dash-cam video from the self-driving Uber car before it collided with a woman, killing her.
Police released two clips, one showing a view outside the vehicle and one from a camera inside the car. Watch the video in the player above. 
Viewer discretion: The video shows the immediate moments before the crash, including the woman walking with her bike in front of the vehicle, but stops short of impact. It may be tough to watch for some viewers. 
“The video is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch, and our thoughts continue to be with Elaine’s loved ones. Our cars remain grounded, and we're assisting local, state and federal authorities in any way we can.”
Attorney James Arrowood teaches the state bar course on driverless vehicles and points out challenges in a possible case.  
"Even if they picked up that person over there, is the car programmed to understand, 'Hey, maybe we slow down because this person is coming into the pathway,'" Arrowood said. "It may not be. If you're driving your car, you can't conceivably slow down every time you see something on a sidewalk."
Authorities said the vehicle was in autonomous mode at the time of the crash. The driver has been identified as 44-year-old Rafaela Vasquez.  
Arrowood says it will come down to a battle of experts conducting sophisticated tests to learn more about the accident. He also says it could cost millions of dollars just to bring the case to a courtroom, so Uber may decide on a settlement.
