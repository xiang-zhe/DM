                    Rugby League has emerged as a popular sport among women in Tonga
                
There's anger in rugby-mad Tonga over a government letter that apparently bans women from playing the sport in public schools. 
The ruling emerged after a member of Tonga High School's girls tag rugby team revealed that they had been withdrawn from a competition last week because they were girls, Matangi Tonga says. 
The official letter has not gone down well with sports administrators and politicians, who see it as a blow to women's rights. 
Even New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden has expressed her disapproval, saying "I would encourage all the young women to engage in whatever sporting code they are interested in."
The Tongan authorities, however, say that the reasoning behind the letter may have been misunderstood.
"Our minister had directed that all government schools, because of the cyclone, are not going to be involved in any sports during this term because we have already lost enough school time," he said, adding that he would be checking to see if the contentious letter was really what the minister had intended.
