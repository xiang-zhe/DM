Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing new sanctions against Venezuela for its controversial "petro" cryptocurrency.
"All transactions related to, provision of financing for, and other dealings in, by a United States person or within the United States, any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token, that was issued by, for, or on behalf of the Government of Venezuela on or after January 9, 2018, are prohibited as of the effective date of this order." 
The sanctions represent the most notable development to date since Venezuela launched the petro in February. As stated at the time by government officials, Venezuela is seeking to use the cryptocurrency as a way to circumvent international sanctions.
Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito said in a statementÂ that there is "nothing new" about the U.S. issuing sanctions: "While Venezuela's attempt to issue a cryptocurrency is novel, there's nothing new about the U.S. restricting financial dealings with sanctioned countries. Issuing a cryptocurrency is not going to help Venezuela escape sanctions."
Time Magazine reported Tuesday that the Russian government helped Venezuela develop the petro cryptocurrency with the support of Vladimir Putin.
A politician from Venezuela's ruling party has denounced U.S. sanctions against the petro, as the sale of the token opens to the public.
Florida senator Bill Nelson has denounced Venezuela's petro token and asked how the U.S. Treasury plans to enforce sanctions.
The Brookings Institute warns that the petro will undermine both international economic sanctions and truly decentralized cryptocurrencies.
