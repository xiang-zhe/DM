"We don’t want a trade war with the United States, or with anybody else. But we are not afraid of it. If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us, we will fight,” Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in a video posted to the Chinese Embassy’s Facebook page.
Earlier this month, Trump also announced steep tariffs — not specific to China — on steel and aluminum imports, despite warnings from U.S. and international lawmakers that doing so could spark a trade war. 
Cui said Thursday that China will do what is necessary to defend its interests and “safeguard the open global trading system.” He suggested doing the latter would also be in the best interests of the U.S. 
“Let me assure those people who intend to fight a trade war: We will certainly fight back. We will retaliate,” he said. “If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer.”
