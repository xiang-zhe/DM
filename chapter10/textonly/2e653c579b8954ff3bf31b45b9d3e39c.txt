Trump and Macron “reiterated their solidarity with the United Kingdom in the wake of Russia’s use of chemical weapons against private citizens on British soil and agreed on the need to take action to hold Russia accountable,” the White House said in a statement. 
The call comes one day after Trump placed a congratulatory call to Putin for his reelection win, but failed to raise the nerve-agent attack and other points of tension between the two countries. 
Moscow has faced widespread condemnation after former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were hospitalized after coming in contact with a powerful nerve agent.
The U.S., U.K. and France have all blamed Russia for the attack, an accusation the Kremlin has denied. 
The Trump administration has taken several steps to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and its military intervention in Ukraine. But the president has long been reluctant to publicly criticize Putin.
