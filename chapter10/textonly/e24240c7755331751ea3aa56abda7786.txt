The new ministerial guidelines, come after the state government was drawn back into controversy about minister Mark Bailey’s use of a private email account, mangocube6@yahoo.co.uk
Palaszczuk had been expected to outlaw the use of private emails before parliament resuming on Tuesday. The new guidelines go further, however, banning Facebook messenger, SnapChat and encryption services Wickr and WhatsApp.
The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has previously said he used Wickr and WhatsApp, as opposed to text messaging, to communicate with MPs and journalists. It’s understood many of the conversations between federal Liberal MPs before the 2015 leadership spill took place using encrypted messaging.
Queensland’s opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, has repeatedly called for Bailey to resign over his use of the private email account, a scandal the government had hoped would disappear before its second term.
Frecklington told reporters in Brisbane the new guidelines were irrelevant if Bailey remained in cabinet and refused to voluntarily release his full tranche of private emails
“The premier didn’t enforce the old guidelines for Bailey, so how can Queenslanders trust that she’ll enforce these new ones?” Frecklington said.
“Cabinet endorsed my decision today. These rules take effect from tomorrow and the ministerial handbook has been updated accordingly,” she said.
“Following findings of the Crime and Corruption Commission on the risks associated with private email use I committed to review our record keeping and information managements policies.
“I have already made clear my expectation that all ministers, assistant ministers and ministerial staff use only government email accounts for official business.”
