NATO countries are working to determine when a cyber attack would trigger the collective defence provision in the allianceâs charter, a US general has said.
“dealing with the issue around this and in cyber and working to define an understanding of what would be a trigger for Article 5,”
“recognises the difficulty in indirect or asymmetric activity that Russia is practising, activities below the level of conflict,”
Collective defence means that an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies.
NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time in its history after the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States.
NATO has taken collective defence measures on several occasions, for instance in response to the situation in Syria and in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
NATO has standing forces on active duty that contribute to the Allianceâs collective defence efforts on a permanent basis.
This is good. About time North Korea and Russia realised cyber attacks are still attacks and will be considered as a hostile act that will lead to a counter attack.
Identifying who attacked you has got to be the biggest problem with this. I can’t imagine they sign off with Boris, St Petersburg.
Whixh is why I feel this should be applied to article 4. Article 5 is far more serious. Then again with the potential damage of cyber attacks these days it depends how bad it is.
