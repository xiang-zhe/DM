            Facebook Took Six Years To Reach $50 Billion Market Value, And Under 48 Hours To Lose That Much Amid Data Flap                    
It took Facebook a total of six years after its launch to reach a $50 billion market value and just two days to lose that same amount after the social media giant was caught up in an international data breach scandal.
This week, Channel 4 News in the U.K. aired a series of investigative reports on Cambridge Analytica, revealing that the company bragged about using prostitutes to entrap politicians and took credit for Trump’s victory by micro-targeting voters based on Facebook activity, including what pages they liked. This led to a backlash against Facebook, including a viral campaign calling on users to delete their social media pages.
Facebook’s stock has taken a major hit in the two days since the report first surfaced, with stock sinking both on Monday and Tuesday and leading to a $50 billion loss in market value.
The campaign calling on users to delete Facebook also continues to build steam, with some sites even posting instructions on how people can completely eliminate their Facebook pages.
