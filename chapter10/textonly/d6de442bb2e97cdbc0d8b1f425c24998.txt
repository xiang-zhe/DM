Chinese state media reported the merger of China Central Television (CCTV), China Radio International and China National Radio under a single network to be named Voice of China.
Xi, in power as head of the Chinese Communist party since 2012, has overseen one of China’s harshest crackdowns on dissent in decades, both among the public and within his own party.
“I think this reflects Xi Jinping’s approach of increasing centralisation and party control so that the Chinese government can project its views globally more effectively and without variation,” said Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute in London.
The new broadcaster’s name echoes that of its US counterpart, Voice of America, the government-funded broadcaster established during the second world war and used throughout the cold war to promote American viewpoints around the world.
China has been working not only to project a more positive image abroad but to compete with western media in global news coverage. In 2016, CCTV rebranded its international operations as China Global Television Network, with bureaux from Nairobi to Washington. It broadcasts from more than 70 countries, while China Radio International broadcasts in more than 60 languages through affiliates around the world. 
 The merger is part of a broader government overhaul – China’s largest in years – bringing more ministries and regulators under closer control by the party. 
 The new broadcaster’s goal will also be to “publicise party theory, guidelines and policies,” according to Xinhua.
