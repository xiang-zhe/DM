The Trump Organization's real estate partner in India is being accused of at least $147 million in fraud.
The complaint said the company was "illegally siphoning off" at least $147 million of investor money and alleges the number could actually approach $200 million.
The real estate investment company had worked with the Trump Organization on a project in India, according to the Post.
The two companies that filed the complaint against IREO include the Children's Investment Fund Foundation and Axon Partners. The companies invested about $300 million total in IREO, according to the Post.
The criminal complaint does not mention IREO's partnership with the Trump Organization, according to the newspaper.
IREO's managing director, Lalit Goyal, wrote in a March 13 letter to the company's investors that "as far as the allegation of fraud, diversion and misappropriation of funds is concerned, that is false, baseless and devoid of any merit."
In the letter, he also called the legal proceedings a "needless and unwarranted distraction," adding that they would result in "significant damage and harm to IREO."
The Trump Organization and IREO had first discussed working together on a commercial real estate tower around 2013, according to the Post, but that deal didn't end up happening.
Goyal offered praise for Trump Jr., saying he was "very focused on what the commercial building should be."
"The shape of the glass, what customers like. He was very businesslike," Goyal said in the 2017 interview.
Trump Jr. did not promote IREO on the trip, only briefly mentioning the real estate partner in a CNBC interview.
