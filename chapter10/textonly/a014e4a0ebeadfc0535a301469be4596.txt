The Philippines Is Moving Toward Allowing Divorce. It’s One of Only Two Countries Where the Process Is Illegal
Catholic protestors carry signs at a "march for life" to oppose a bill legalizing divorce in Manila, Philippines on Feb. 24, 2018.
The country’s lower house of Congress voted Monday to pass a bill allowing couples to dissolve “irreparable marriages” and remarry, with 134 lawmakers voting for and 57 against, with two abstentions, Reuters reports. The only other country where divorce is illegal is the Vatican City.
The Philippines’ Senate will need to pass its own version of the bill in order to enact a law, but it has not yet begun to draft one, according to Reuters. If the Senate does pass a bill, President Duterte could still veto it from becoming law.
