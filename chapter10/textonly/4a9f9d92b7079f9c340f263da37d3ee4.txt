The crackdown on sexual harassment would mean fines for “degrading or humiliating comments” or hostile and offensive “sexual or sexist” behaviour towards a person in a public place. The minister for gender equality, Marlène Schiappa, has explained this could include situations such as men aggressively asking a woman for her phone number dozens of times when she is clear she is not interested, as well as sexual intimidation and harassment on public transport. 
Schiappa said this week that the fines would range from €90 to €750. They could be far higher for repeat offenders or in the case of aggravating circumstances. “The idea is that it is high enough to be a deterrent but also that we could be sure the harasser can pay it immediately, so that the law can be efficient,” she said.
At the UN in New York this month, Schiappa said: “We have to say: ‘Young men, you don’t have the right, you’re not allowed to follow women on the streets, to intimidate them.’”
The new law will also give people who have been raped as children more time to file a complaint. They will be able to do so until they are 48, an extension of 10 years. 
The bill also aims to increase sanctions against cyberstalking and online sexual harassment, particularly when committed by a group of several people targeting one person.
