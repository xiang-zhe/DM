The children's book has attracted widespread criticism for featuring the German dictator alongside Barack Obama,Â Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Narendra Modi andÂ Aung San Suu Kyi.
A blurb on the back of the 2016 book states that the aim is to âfocus on some of these powerful world leaders who have dedicated their lives to the betterment of their countries.â
The kids’ book is being slammed by many, who demand that stores stop selling the book and website remove it.
But according toÂ Rabbi Abraham CooperÂ of the Simon Wiesenthal Center,Â an international Jewish human rights organisation, placing the German dictator â who “started WWII, which left tens of millions dead and mass-murdered six million Jews during the Nazi Holocaustâ alongside “truly great political and humanitarian leaders” is an “abomination.”
Cooper further said in a statement that what is worse is that the book “targets young people with little or no knowledge of world historyâ.
High school textbooks published by the Gujarat State Board of School Textbooks in 2004, when the state was under Modi’s realm, glorified fascism and Nazism while finding faults with India’s freedom movement.
“Hitler lent dignity and prestige to the German government within a short time by establishing a strong administrative set up. He created the vast state of Greater Germany. He adopted the policy of opposition towards the Jewish people and advocated the supremacy of the German race. He adopted a new economic policy and brought prosperity to Germany.”
The extermination of millions of Jews and others by the end of the Second World War finds but a brief mention.
