        The investigation into the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia will likely take weeks, if not months, the Metropolitan Police has announced, calling the probe "extremely challenging and complex."

    
"This is an extremely challenging and complex investigation and we currently have around 250 exceptionally experienced and dedicated specialist officers from the counter-terrorism network working around the clock on this case,"
"They are being supported by hundreds more officers from across the police family, as well as the military and other emergency services."
"They are making good progress in what is a painstaking investigation that is likely to be ongoing for weeks, if not months."
Basu's comments were published in a renewed appeal for information from anyone who may have seen Sergei Skripal's burgundy BMW 320D saloon car with the license plate HD09 WAO. It comes after an initial appeal for information was issued earlier this week.
"We need to establish Sergei and Yulia's movements during the morning, before they headed to the town center. Did you see this car, or what you believe was this car, on the day of the incident? We are particularly keen to hear from you if you saw the car before 1:30pm. If you have information, please call the police on 101,"
