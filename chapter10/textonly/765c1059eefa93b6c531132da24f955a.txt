But the release on Tuesday night of secretly-recorded videos allegedly showing the president’s supporters attempting to buy political support ended any possibility that Kuczysnki could survive the attempt to force him out. 
The video clips shown in a news conference feature a government official explaining to a lawmaker how to make easy money from government projects for his region, while congressman Kenji Fujimori, assures him of government protection. 
In his address on Wednesday, Kuczynski blamed “selectively tendentious” edited recording for giving the impression of vote buying and said “political confrontation had created a climate of ungovernability” which did enormous damage to the country.
Government ministers have denied contracts were awarded in exchange for political support and announced they would fire the official. Kenji Fujimori also denied wrongdoing, saying the recordings were a reflection of typical negotiations to get infrastructure projects off the ground.
