Mozilla, the makers of the popular Firefox web browser, said it will stop advertising on Facebook following a data scandal impacting tens of millions of users.
"When Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares customer data, specifically strengthening its default privacy settings for third party apps, weâll consider returning," wrote Mozilla.
Pressure from lawmakers and critics is mounting for Facebook seeking answers for how Cambridge Analytica obtained the data and why it took Facebook so long to disclose the misuse.
