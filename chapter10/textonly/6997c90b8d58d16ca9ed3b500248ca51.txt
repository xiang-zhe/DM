The Japanese government is offering $940 million to fund space start-ups in a new push to grow the industry, the government announced Tuesday at an event in Tokyo.
Japanese start-ups such as ispace see the new funding as key to the long-term growth of the nation's space industry.

Japan is offering $940 million to fund space start-ups in a new push to grow the industry, the government announced Tuesday at an event in Tokyo. 
"We believe this will be remembered as a turning point for our burgeoning industry," Takeshi Hakamada, CEO and founder of lunar exploration start-up ispace, said in a statement. 
While ispace is based in Japan, the company also has subsidiary offices in Luxembourg and California. Having a legal framework of ownership will be critical to the start-up's success once exploratory missions begin collecting materials and information.
"We're going to bring scientific instruments to the moon, and then sell the right to use our data to space agencies and other institutions, as well as provide transportation services, for profit," Hakamada said.
