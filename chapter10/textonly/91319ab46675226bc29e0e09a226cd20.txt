Southern Wisconsin in debris path of falling Chinese space stati - WKOW 27: Madison, WI Breaking News, Weather and Sports
(WKOW) -- A Chinese space station is losing altitude and could fall back to earth in late March or early April. Southern Wisconsin is in an area that has a higher probability of seeing debris, according to an agency that tracks satellites.
The Tiangong-1 space station was initially launched in September 2011. An official Chinese statement declared that Tiangong-1 terminated its data service on March 21, 2016. Since the Chinese government has lost control of the station, it's hard to predict where and when it will fall, according to CNN.
Aerospace says it is much easier to predict a re-entry time than a location. This explains the wide scope of possible re-entry zones, which both Aerospace and other organizations predict will be between 43 degrees North and 43 degrees South latitudes.
Southern Wisconsin is right on the edge of this span. While many scientists believe most of the object will burn up while entering the atmosphere, there is still a chance some debris makes its way all the way to the ground.
According to Aerospace, there is a chance that a small amount of Tiangong-1 debris may survive reentry and impact the ground.
Should this happen, any surviving debris would fall within a region that is a few hundred kilometers in size and centered along a point on the Earth that the station passes over.
The map (attached) shows the relative probabilities of debris landing within a given region. Yellow indicates locations that have a higher probability while green indicates areas of lower probability.
Blue areas have zero probability of debris reentry since Tiangong-1 does not fly over these areas (north of 42.7° N latitude or south of 42.7° S latitude). These zero probability areas constitute about a third of the total Earth’s surface area.
