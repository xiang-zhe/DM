Kushner, who had been tasked with bringing about a deal between Israel and Palestine, was particularly engaged by information about the Middle East, according to a former White House official and a former U.S. intelligence professional.
In June, Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman ousted his cousin, then-Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, and took his place as next in line to the throne, upending the established line of succession. In the months that followed, the Presidentâs Daily Brief contained information on Saudi Arabiaâs evolving political situation, including a handful of names of royal family members opposed to the crown princeâs power grab, according to the former White House official and two U.S. government officials with knowledge of the report. Like many others interviewed for this story, they declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about sensitive matters to the press.
What exactly Kushner and the Saudi royal talked about in Riyadh may be known only to them, but after the meeting, Crown Prince Mohammed told confidants that Kushner had discussed the names of Saudis disloyal to the crown prince, according to three sources who have been in contact with members of the Saudi and Emirati royal families since the crackdown. Kushner, through his attorneyâs spokesperson, denies having done so.
âSome questions by the media are so obviously false and ridiculous that they merit no response. This is one. The Intercept should know better,â said Peter Mirijanian, a spokesperson for Kushnerâs lawyer Abbe Lowell.
The Saudi Embassy did not respond to questions from The Intercept. The White House referred questions to National Security Council spokesperson Michael Anton. Anton declined to comment, referring questions on Kushnerâs discussions with MBS to Lowell.
It is likely that Crown Prince Mohammed would have known who his critics were without Kushner mentioning them, a U.S. government official who declined to be identified pointed out. The crown prince may also have had his own reasons for saying that Kushner shared information with him, even if that wasnât true. Just the appearance that Kushner did so would send a powerful message to the crown princeâs allies and enemies that his actions were backed by the U.S. government.
One of the people MBS told about the discussion with Kushner was UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, according to a source who talks frequently to confidants of the Saudi and Emirati rulers. MBS bragged to the Emirati crown prince and others that Kushner was “in his pocket,” the source told The Intercept.
Access to the Presidentâs Daily Brief is tightly guarded, but Trump has the legal authority to allow Kushner to disclose information contained in it. If Kushner discussed names with MBS as an approved tactic of U.S. foreign policy, the move would be a striking intervention by the U.S. into an unfolding power struggle at the top levels of an allied nation. If Kushner discussed the names with the Saudi prince without presidential authorization, however, he may have violated federal laws around the sharing of classified intelligence.
On November 6, two days after the detentions in the Ritz began, Trump took to Twitter to defend the crackdown:
I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing….
Asked about Kushnerâs use of WhatsApp to communicate with foreign officials, his attorneyâs spokesperson Mirijanian said, âWithout commenting on who he talks with and how he does his work, Mr. Kushner is in conformity with the Presidential Records Act and other rules.â Kushnerâs attorneys have since told him not to use the app for official business, according to a source with direct knowledge of the exchange.
Kushnerâs unconventional communications with regional leaders excluded diplomats during the summer of 2017, when Saudi Arabia and the UAE initiated an economic blockade aimed at weakening their Gulf neighbor Qatar. Tillersonâs attempts to mediate the crisis were quickly undercut by Trump and Kushner, who supported the blockade. Three State Department officials told The Intercept that Tillerson was largely in the dark about Kushnerâs communications with MBS during that period.
In the wake of MBSâs crackdown in Saudi Arabia, the National Security Council’s policy coordination committee suggested that Tillerson intervene and try to reason with the crown prince, according to a former White House official and a former State Department official. Tillerson declined, telling colleagues doing so would be “pointless” given that Kushner was already in close and direct contact with him.
The National Security Council’s Middle East adviser, retired U.S. Army Col. Michael Bell, has also complained in recent months that he was out of the loop on the Gulf crisis and the Arab-Israeli conflict, the former White House official said. Bell has told colleagues that Kushner frequently micromanaged those subjects through direct interaction with regional leaders, without offering Bell any worthwhile readout on their interactions.
Bell, speaking through National Security Council spokesperson Anton, denied that Kushner has kept him out of the loop and said he respects Kushnerâs lead role in the region.

âWe could not understand why the Trump administration was so firmly taking the Saudisâ side in this dispute between the Saudis, the Emiratis, and Qatar, because the United States has very important interests in Qatar,â Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told George Stephanopoulos, host of ABCâs âThis Week,â after The Intercept reported on Kushner Companiesâ efforts to obtain financing from Qatar. Murphy was referring to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, home of U.S. Central Command, where thousands of U.S. troops are stationed.
âIf the reason this administration put U.S. troops at risk in Qatar was to protect the Kushnersâ financial interests, then thatâs all the evidence you need to make some big changes in the White House,â Murphy said.
MBS is in Washington this week. On Tuesday, he was warmly received by Trump, who told reporters that the U.S.-Saudi relationship is âprobably the strongest itâs ever been.â
