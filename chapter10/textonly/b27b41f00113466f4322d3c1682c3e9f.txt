The Sullivan brothers, five sailors renowned during WWII, died aboard the ship when it was struck by an enemy torpedo.
During the second World War, the Sullivan brothers were the faces of patriotic sacrifice in the U.S. 
When the ship sank, 687 peopleâthe brothers includedâdied with it. Only 10 were rescued in the days following the ship's destruction. 
Underwater video taken of the shipwreck shows the hulking remains. Barnacles and other sea life has overgrown the metal.
