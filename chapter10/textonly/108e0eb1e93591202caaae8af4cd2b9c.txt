				Norway's right-wing government could resign this week if the justice minister loses a no-confidence vote after she triggered outrage among survivors of a 2011 gun massacre, media reported on Sunday.

			


	The post, which contained a photo showing Al-Shabab militants, sparked uproar because Labour members had been targeted in 2011 in the worst attack on Norwegian soil since the end of World War 2.


	On July 22 that year, right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik, who once was a member of the FrP, killed 77 people in twin attacks: one targeting then Labour prime minister Jens Stoltenberg's office in Oslo and another against a Labour youth camp on the island of Ut√∏ya.


	Much may rest on the Christian Democratic Party -- which is not part of the government but largely supports its motions despite frequent disputes with Listhaug.


	Public radio and the daily Verdens Gang on Sunday reported that Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg would step down were Listhaug to lose the confidence vote.
Studies show that companies with women in senior management perform better than those without. Yet women are still much less likely to hold leadership positions than men. So, what gives?
