Whoever murdered the Putin critic who warned he was on a Russian hit list didn't break in, and didn't use poison

 Whoever is behind the murder of a prominent Russian exile, who believed he was on a Kremlin hit list, managed to get inside his home without breaking in, police believe. 
 Nikolai Glushkov, 68, was found dead at home last week at his home in southwest London, and officers are now hunting for the culprits. His official cause of death is "compression to the neck." 
 Before his death, Glushkov warned that a close friend of his had been murdered, and that he would be next. 
 In a Monday morning update on the investigation, the Metropolitan Police said they examined Glushkov's house and found no signs of forced entry. 
 They also believe that no noxious substances were used in the attack on him, in contrast to former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, who was poisoned the previous week in Salisbury with a military-grade nerve agent. 
 Commander Clarke Jarrett of the Metropolitan Police said of the Glushkov case: "The investigation is progressing; we have taken a number of statements and have over 400 exhibits which are being processed. 
 "We have found no sign of forced entry thus far, but the forensic examination at Mr Glushkov's home continues and we expect to be there for some time.                                                         
                    
    
 "I must stress that there is nothing we have found in our investigation so far to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury and I would like to reassure the public in New Malden that there are no wider public health concerns in relation to this investigation."
