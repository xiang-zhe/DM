Vladimir Putin re-elected: Modi, Xi Jinping, Maduro congratulate Russian president amid silence from EU, US
Putin’s victory will take his political dominance of Russia to nearly a quarter of a century until 2024, the longest rule since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, by which time Putin will be 71. He has promised to use his new term to beef up Russia’s defences against the West and to raise living standards.
In an outcome that was never in doubt, the Central Election Commission, with nearly 100 percent of the votes counted, announced that Putin, who has run Russia as president or prime minister since 1999, had won 76.66 percent of the vote.
Most world leaders, however, did not rush to congratulate the Russian president. The following are the ones who did:
"Conveying his compliments on Putin's success, the prime minister expressed the hope that under Putin's leadership, the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and the Russian Federation will continue to grow from strength to strength," the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement.
"The Prime Minister also stated that he looked forward to welcoming President Putin in India for the annual summit later this year," it added.
"Currently, the China-Russia comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership is at the best level in history, which sets an example for building a new type of international relations," Xi said in a congratulatory message to Putin.
"Please accept my heartfelt congratulations on your re-election as Russian president and best wishes to further steer your country along the clearly defined path of progress for the benefit of all its citizens. I am confident that with you outstanding talent of a leader with a clear understanding and inflexible will, responsibility and commitment to your cause, you will continue to achieve success in solving all issues important for Russia and in implementing plans for its further comprehensive development," the statement said.
"Under your effective guidance, Russia has been firmly pursuing the path of large-scale political and economic reforms aimed at improving people’s social conditions and ensuring the country’s active role in resolving pressing global and economic issues," Nazarbayev said in his message.
