Eleven cow protection vigilantes in the Indian state of Jharkhand have been sentenced to life in prison for killing a Muslim man who was transporting beef. 
On the morning of 29 June 2017, the men were part of a mob that pulled Alimuddin Ansari from his vehicle, beat him to death and then set the car on fire. Videos of the crime showed the men thrashing Ansari with pieces of meat while the car burned nearby.
Extremist Hindu groups, many of which claim to be affiliated with Bharatiya Janata, have been implicated in a wave of attacks on Muslims and low-caste Hindus carried out in the name of the cow, which many Hindus regard as sacred.
Days before the attack on Ansari, another man in Jharkhand was reportedly beaten and had his house torched after a cow carcass was found near his home. Four Muslim men were killed in another village in the state in May.
Police are often accused of condoning or ignoring cow vigilantism, in many cases charging the victims with cow smuggling or illegal slaughter. 
Ansariâs wife, Mariam Khatun, told journalists outside the court that she mourned her husband but âdid not want more bloodshedâ. His son, Shahzad Ansari, told the Guardian he was âhappy the court has taken the right decisionâ.
âMy father was not doing anything wrong,â he said. âNobody should take the law into their hands.â
