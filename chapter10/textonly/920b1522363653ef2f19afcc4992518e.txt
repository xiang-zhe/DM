Rodrigo Duterte’s bloody drug war continues with more than a dozen deaths on Wednesday after officers fire ‘in self defence’
Philippine police killed 13 suspected drug dealers and arrested more than 100 people in dozens of anti-narcotics operations on Wednesday in a province north of the capital, its police chief said.
More than 4,000 Filipinos have been killed by police, and thousands more by unidentified armed men, during President Rodrigo Duterte’s controversial 20-month war on drugs. Most killings have been in rundown areas of Manila and the nearby provinces of Bulacan and Cavite.
Human rights groups and Duterte’s political opponents say executions of drug users and small-time peddlers are widespread, but police insist those killed were all dealers who put up violent resistance.
 Bulacan is where 32 people were killed in a single day in August last year. Last month, an additional 10 drug suspects died in a bloody night of drug busts.
 “These operations are part of our stepped-up campaign against drugs and all other forms of criminality in the province,” Bulacan police chief Romeo Caramat said in a statement. “Unfortunately, 13 of the suspects were killed when our officers fired in self-defence shortly after the suspects who were armed with concealed guns sensed they were being entrapped and started firing.”
 More than 100 people were also arrested and 19 firearms and about 250 packets of suspected drugs were seized during the 24-hour operation, Caramat said.
