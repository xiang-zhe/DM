Cambridge Analytica is scrambling to respond after a British television channel aired an undercover report that showed its chief executive discussing potential bribery and entrapment.
 The embattled data analytics company said in a statement on Monday that the report had been "edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business." 
 Nix said in the statement that he had "entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios" to avoid embarrassing a potential client. He said the company does not engage in entrapment or bribery. 
 The United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office has opened an investigation, and the data protection authority said Monday that it was trying to obtain a warrant to search the offices of Cambridge Analytica. 
 The Channel 4 report, which will continue with another segment on Tuesday, showed Nix suggesting to prospective clients that he could "send some girls around to the candidate's house" in order to obtain compromising material. 
 Nix said no. "Just saying we could bring some Ukranians in," he said, adding "they are very beautiful, I find that works very well." 
 It is illegal in the United States and the United Kingdom to bribe public officials. Cambridge Analytica is registered in the United States and operates in the United Kingdom. 
 "I am aware how this looks... I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps,' and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose," he said.
