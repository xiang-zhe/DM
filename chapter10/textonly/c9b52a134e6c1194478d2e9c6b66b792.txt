The government in South Korea's capital is introducing a new initiative to force its employees to leave work on time - by powering down all their computers at 20:00 on Fridays. 
The shutdown initiative in the Seoul Metropolitan Government is set to roll out across three phases over the next three months.
The second phase starts in April, with employees having their computers turned off by 19:30 on the second and fourth Friday that month.
According to a SMG statement, all employees will be subjected to the shutdown, though exemptions may be provided in special circumstances.

However, not every government worker seems to be on-board - according to the SMG, 67.1% of government workers have asked to be exempt from the forced lights-out.
Earlier this month, South Korea's national assembly passed a law to cut down the maximum weekly working hours to 52, down from 68.
