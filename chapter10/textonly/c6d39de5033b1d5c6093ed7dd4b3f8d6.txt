The human rights group accused Twitter of failing to respect women’s rights, with users in the dark as to how it interpreted and enforced its policies intended to prevent such toxic content. The result, Amnesty said, was death threats, rape threats and racist, transphobic and homophobic abuse aimed at women.
“The trolls are currently winning, because despite repeated promises, Twitter is failing to do enough to stop them. Twitter must take concrete steps to address and prevent violence and abuse against women on its platform, otherwise its claim to be on women’s side is meaningless.”
The report was based on interviews with more than 80 women, including politicians, journalists, and regular users in the UK and USA. While it found that public figures were often targets, others also experienced abuse – particularly if they spoke out about sexism or used campaign hashtags.
Amnesty documented how women from ethnic or religious minorities, LGBTI women, non-binary individuals and those with disabilities were targeted with specific abuse against their identities. It said this could have the effect of “driving already marginalised voices further out of public conversations”.
