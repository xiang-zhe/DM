Zukhra Chomaeva, another election official at polling station number 217, said: “How do I know if they’re the same person? They might look the same.” 
Many of the people photographed appeared to be state employees: Sklyarevskaya was identified by a colleague as a hospital deputy director of health and safety.
Sklyarevskaya arrived to vote with a group of eight other women and one man through the gates of polling station 216. About 20 minutes later, the same group were observed voting again a few hundred metres away at polling station 215. 
Approached about the incident, Sklyarevskaya said she had voted only once, at a third polling station, number 217. “Who directed you to do this investigation?” she asked. “You do not have the right to get involved in the electoral system.” 
Official results released on Monday showed the three polling stations in Ust-Djeguta had an average turnout of 81.5% and delivered a majority for Putin of 89.86%. National turnout was 67%, according to the central election commission. 
At polling station number 216, a count revealed there were not enough ballot papers to tally with the figure for Putin votes – 1,299 – that officials had provisionally pencilled in. When a recount produced the same outcome, the election officials said they were going home. 
When Reuters reporters asked how the officials could go home at that point, the director of the school hosting the polling station said: “You want to cast doubt on Putin’s victory?”
