Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is in police custody over allegations he received funds from late Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi.
The questions relate to the financing of his 2007 presidential campaign, which he won, according to Le Monde.
A former minister and close ally of Sarkozy, Brice Hortefeux, was also being questioned by police on Tuesday morning in relation to the Libya investigation, another source close to the probe said.
Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, has always denied receiving any illicit campaign funding and has dismissed the Libyan allegations as ‘grotesque’.
In January French businessman Alexandre Djouhri, suspected by investigators of funnelling money from Gaddafi to finance Sarkozy’s campaign, was arrested in Britain and granted bail after he appeared in a London court.
Sarkozy has already been ordered to stand trial in a separate matter concerning financing of his failed re-election campaign in 2012, when he was defeated by Francois Hollande.
