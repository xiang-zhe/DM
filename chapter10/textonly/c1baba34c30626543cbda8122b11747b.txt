Meerut: Nearly 350 Brahmins from Varanasi gathered at the Bhainsali ground of Meerut city on Sunday morning to begin a nine-day-long ‘mahayagya’ in which they will burn 500 quintals of mango wood to “reduce pollution”
This rather strange event organized by members of Shri Ayutchandi Mahayagya Samiti will see the wood being burnt in 108 fire-pits
The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board has refused to intervene in the matter as “it is related to a particular religion”
