Charges have been dropped against 11 members of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's security detail that were accused of beating protesters in Washington, D.C.
Federal prosecutors made the decision to drop the charges against 11 of the 15 security members in connection with the incident.
The scuffle took place last May after roughly two dozen protesters gathered outside of the Turkish Embassy to protest Erdoğan's policies during his visit to Washington.
Nine people were taken to local hospitals following the incident. The Turkish Embassy said that Erdoğan's bodyguards were acting in "self-defense” during the incident and accused the protesters of being affiliated with the terrorist group PKK.
The clash was criticized by Washington, D.C., police and local officials, who described it as a violent attack on peaceful demonstrators.
The incident came as U.S. officials were attempting to improve fragile relations with Turkey, a key NATO ally and partner in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
