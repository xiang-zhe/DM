Yet the Holy Grail of artificial intelligence and the convergence of quantum computing and new ways of thinking about possibly deep learning or another system of AI development means the essential breakthroughs that will occur, will probably take place in China and will thus be in a sense, owned by China for a certain period. This may give them a certain economic benefit and a kind of technological advantage.</p><p name="cda4" id="cda4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">New ways of thinking about machine learning and how to help smart machines “learn how to learn” will come from places and companies and smart cities that are themselves experiencing their own mini Golden Ages. We know Chinese centers circa 2025 will be experiencing such an atmosphere. Thus, logically we have to admit that they have the rational best shot at achieving AI-breakthroughs that may never be possible in the U.S. again, at least not in our lifetimes. This is because apart from all other things, the best typically want to work with the best.</p><p name="a55a" id="a55a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The United States, on the other hand, seems to be experiencing a steady decline in its artificial intelligence initiatives. To return back to the AI conference, While 34 percent of the academic papers presented in the 2017 AAAI were still American, the number shows a significant decrease from the output of the country’s researchers back in 2012, when studies from the United States represented 41 percent of the academic papers in the conference. That’s pretty empirical evidence that relatively, China is ascending where America is in decline. As a futurist, it’s statistics like these that change how I view the role of China not just economically and as a leader in the smart grid, but in how smart machines scale to become part of our lives in smart cities all over the globe. I’m Canadian, I personally don’t care where innovation takes place, I’m just pointing to available facts.</p><p name="1018" id="1018" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to Futurism, the United States’ current levels of R&amp;D spending on AI are one-half to one-quarter of the levels that would be best for economic growth. China on the other hand, have made becoming a leader in AI, one of the state’s primary goals to illustrate the advent of New China. This is where the facts become scary. China’s one-party rule affords them an incredible ability to “get shit done.” I don’t suspect developing AI will be a major issue for them, as having a higher population here becomes an essential advantage. More collaboration and a bigger slices of funding and Big Data, will win this war. The wheels of Chinese supremacy in AI have been set in motion.</p><figure name="138f" id="138f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 641px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 91.60000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*IPnXr41Qi8JY6ZFNFWgV3g.png" data-width="808" data-height="740" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*IPnXr41Qi8JY6ZFNFWgV3g.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*IPnXr41Qi8JY6ZFNFWgV3g.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Data from the NSTC’s AI R&amp;D Plan.

As a Futurist, I believe the start-point for that even is circa 2022. American original content streaming, digital advertising and AI is likely to consolidate into two or three winners (and I don’t believe Apple or Netflix will be among them). By the mid 2020s, it will likely just be Amazon and Alphabet left standing. Facebook has a digital ads giant, may not have such a bright future. Even as big a monopoly as Amazon is destined to become, as many jobs as it will create for Americans, it’s literally nothing compared to the Chinese Tech Dynasty that’s coming in the form of Tencent, Alibaba, Didi, Huawei, Xiaomi, Baidu and so many others.</p><p name="0dd2" id="0dd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Admittedly, this is hard for many Americans and Europeans to get their head around.

One of the key indicators is also in terms of investments. At home we can witness Silicon VAlley has entered a period of stagnation, where Chinese 1st tier cities have entered another a period of incredible growth.

Techno-collectivism is in this sense more native to how AI-consciousness, whatever you might call it, can emerge.</p><p name="fd67" id="fd67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Human beings as separate entities, will always be kind of dumb. They won’t suddenly dramatically improve their capabilities. Smart machines working in a framework of collective collaboration and efficient cooperation, can in a sense hyper-specialize in a way that means how automation manifests in China vs. the United States, is fundamentally different. How this scales is also expected to impact how machine learning might come to learn how to learn better. Once self-learning AI is achieved, of the nature of a general intelligence, well all of humanity will have a reckoning (if at all such a thing is possible).</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="579a" id="579a" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*SDmAkJ87SF5C8CvsDEIF5w.jpeg" data-width="3500" data-height="1970" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SDmAkJ87SF5C8CvsDEIF5w.jpeg"></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="e3d8" id="e3d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This means corporations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/google-wants-to-hire-ai-talent-from-china/" data-href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/google-wants-to-hire-ai-talent-from-china/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">such as Google</a>, Apple and Amazon are desperately trying to cherry-pick AI talent in China as well.

Without Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft doing good work, would America even be in the picture of the fortront of the intersection between human beings and AI? That’s part of the problem, as Tech stocks surge in 2018, winners win big and competition is drying up. Competition is arguably more fierce between Tencent and Alibaba, than it is between Google and Amazon. Since Tencent and Alibaba have technological “children” that are growing up, it takes a sorto of childish logic to see how Chinese Tech monopolies will one day “gang up” on American ones, just as the early web was the property of American firms.

Near its hundred year anniversary in 2021, that’s when the Golden Age of China truly begins, and frankly it doesn’t matter what state the U.S. is in or what Amazon or Google will be doing, China is on the path to being in a league of their own.</p><p name="4512" id="4512" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Patents, computing milestones, AI research citations, all of these are signals. The report published by CB Insights also highlights the momentum coming from China regarding patent applications, which seems set to overtake those made by the Americans. As far as deep learning is concerned, the number of patents issued in China is around six times greater than those published in the US. What are these micro indications really telling us about the future? The artificial intelligence of the future will have Chinese values, whatever they may be. It does not actually matter what AI-regulations the White House puts in place, because AI won’t be a proprietary American invention anymore. For alarmists, this is somewhat disturbing.

One of the reasons some popular minds and scientists speculate, could be due to the perils of Artificial Intelligence. If used as a weapon, it could be devastating. From social infrastructures being weaponized, to apps and algorithms influencing our attention and a precarious uncertainty hanging in our future, the daunting conflict between nations is still a significant cause for concern in an era where our ‘tools’ could be too powerful indeed. The danger of man’s aggressive tendencies is still apparently real enough and it may be that as life-inhabiting planets are common in the galaxy, self-annihilation may be nearly as common.</p><p name="893a" id="893a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">China is now embarking on an unprecedented effort to master artificial intelligence, and for all intents and purposes America will be unable to follow or replicate it.

For instance, a month before the State Council’s report, the government of the Chinese city of Tianjin had announced a USD 5 billion fund to support the AI industry. Baidu has been enormously prioritizing AI for years. Alibaba and Tencent are as well.</p><p name="fb9d" id="fb9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That Government and Industry are working so closely together on joint goals shows China’s framework of governance might be superior in terms of AI’s impact on GDP and economic development. Silicon Valley has created some high-tech jobs, but has also displaced a lot of jobs and will continue to do so as the likes of Walmart are forced to pivot into becoming a technology companies by Amazon. China’s prioritization in government funding and the private sector in the push for AI creates jobs and opportunities.</p><p name="eacb" id="eacb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">China’s AI plans includes robotics and the next-web as definitive layers of technological progress along with AI itself. China’s government support for AI-related development demonstrates a consistent emphasis on robotics and indigenous innovation, an indication that smart manufacturing will continue to be a priority. This in short will enable China to be among the leaders in automation and an active enabler of other countries to do it.</p><h4 name="3735" id="3735" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">China’s 3-Step Plan for AI</h4><blockquote name="76bb" id="76bb" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--h4">1) By 2020, China’s AI industry will be “in line” with the most advanced countries, with a core AI industry gross output exceeding RMB 150 billion (USD 22.5 billion) and AI-related industry gross output exceeding RMB 1 trillion (USD 150.8 billion).</blockquote><blockquote name="52ca" id="52ca" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">2) By 2025, China aims to reach a “world-leading” level in some AI fields, with a core AI industry gross output exceeding RMB 400 billion (USD 60.3 billion) and AI-related industry gross output exceeding RMB 5 trillion (USD 754.0 billion).</blockquote><blockquote name="627f" id="627f" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">3) By 2030, China seeks to become the world’s “primary” AI innovation center, with a core AI industry gross output exceeding RMB 1 trillion (USD 150.8 billion) and AI-related gross output exceeding RMB 10 trillion (USD 1.5 trillion).</blockquote><p name="9ca9" id="9ca9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">China’s 5-year plans shows a clear indication of where it wants to be heading. China’s agility in the 2020s sets in apart on a entirely different trajectory from America.</p><p name="d1b4" id="d1b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">China’s AI industry had a gross output of RMB 10 billion in 2016, and is expected to grow to around RMB 15 billion in 2017. Thus, the 2020 benchmark for the core AI industry’s gross output (RMB 150 billion) would represent a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">tenfold increase of the AI industry </strong>in the next three years. The curve begins circa 2019 and by 2022 is significantly different from the ability of another other country on Earth. By 2030, it’s not just the acknowledged leader economically but in AI as well.</p><p name="1fb3" id="1fb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By the mid 2020s China is no longer in a position where it needs to be reactionary to what the U.S. is doing in terms of AI development and policy planning, it’s “setting the pace.” That’s when the changing of the guard truly takes place and the Chinese Tech Dynasty is truly starting to rise. This is why as a futurist I have stated that Chinese’s golden age truly begins in 2022.</p><p name="6afc" id="6afc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In October 2016, the Obama administration released the first of three reports on AI, which also corresponded with a large spike in Baidu searches for AI. China has up until now been somewhat reactionary to the U.S., but with a leader that is set to continue on long-term, this all changes. It’s no secret that AI is probably not foremost on the mind of someone as old as Donald Trump. When one Superpower stumbles, another takes its place and this is what has been occuring throughout history as empires rise and fall and as different tribes have contributed to the evolution of human “tools”.</p><p name="2e69" id="2e69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s bizarre to think that AlphaGo’s mastery of Go, an ancient game of China, signaled to China that it had to develop its AI capability, almost as a matter of national pride. The Chinese government even banned outlets from covering its May 2016 match with the Chinese player Ke Jie, the world’s number one player at the time.</p><p name="123e" id="123e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chinese government support for AI development, emphasis on indigenous innovation, and prioritization of frontier technologies traces back to February 2006, when the State Council issued their “National Medium- and Long-Term Plan (MLP) for the Development of Science and Technology (2006–2020), as stated in the Oxford University report. Beijing has been at this, for quite some time.</p><p name="b068" id="b068" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In convergence with AI, is China’s leadership in biotechnology. These international transfer of both technology and talent, as well as investment in whole-of-society and long-term measures. That is, China is playing to an end-game where technology is leveraged for economic and political advantage that greatly benefits global citizens, and not just Chinese citizens and consumers.</p><h4 name="3642" id="3642" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">China’s Long-term Bets Amount to an Invulnerable Strategic Advantage</h4><p name="9111" id="9111" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">China is making several long-term bets from creating hyper-specialized startup communities, to building supercomputing facilities to specialized R&amp;D facilities that could in the long-run, change the course of the history of technology.</p><p name="c07d" id="c07d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From Huawei AI chips to Cambricon, a state backed startup valued at $1 billion, has developed chips that are six times faster than the standard GPUs for deep learning applications and use a fraction of the power consumption; there’s some sense that China has caught up or is rapidly catching up in hardware.</p><p name="259d" id="259d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">China’s techno-nationalism, an approach that aggressively protects domestic companies from foreign competitors is part of the long-game where Data is the key driver and the 98-fastball in China’s arsenal to achieve AI superiority. China can replicate everything else given the funding, organization and time. Possessing the data of some 800 million chinese consumer, without many restrictions means China has an ace up its sleeve other countries cannot copy.</p><p name="b288" id="b288" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However it would be a mistaken of the West to believe Chinese policy makers have no sense of the importance of data privacy. Recently, in January 2018, advocates for data privacy celebrated when the Chinese government released a new national standard on the protection of personal information, which contains more comprehensive and onerous requirements than even the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, per analysis by CSIS senior fellow Samm Sack, according to the Oxford University report.</p><p name="96d5" id="96d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One sector where Chinese efforts are still failing are with regards to talent programs that have not managed to attract the “best and brightest” Chinese scientists to return to the mainland. As China continues to modernize, this will be one of the key challenges in the race for AI. China must not only be able to attract its best academic researchers back to China, but to attract the top 1% of global talent in AI research.</p><figure name="895f" id="895f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*2itNPjZQpamm6dmde5RG9Q.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="800" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*2itNPjZQpamm6dmde5RG9Q.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*2itNPjZQpamm6dmde5RG9Q.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="3796" id="3796" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In order to recruit foreign talent, the BAT companies have established their own overseas AI institutes. As companies like JD.com, Didi, Toutiao and NIO grow internationally, they too need to be able to attract and retain Western talent. Headhunters working for China’s city governments and technology companies regularly visit international scholars and engineers in universities, companies, and startups and attempt to convince them to work in China. Yet only when China is perceived to be a leader in AI, and has significant measures in place to make foreign talent feel safe and welcome, can this occur at scale.</p><p name="4510" id="4510" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, China is taking the long-view to growing AI talent. The State Council’s plan also calls for constructing an AI academic discipline, involving a comprehensive effort to establish AI majors, because there really is no talent quite like home-grown talent.</p><p name="b218" id="b218" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the commercial AI ecosystem, the Chinese government actively picks winners in the AI space. This is quite unlike the so-called free market system in America. For example, in November 2017, MoST designated four companies — Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and iFlyTek — to lead the development of national AI innovation platforms in self-driving cars, smart cities, computer vision for medical diagnosis, and voice intelligence, respectively. The mandates of commercial companies in China are much more recognized and state-sponsored. While still somewhat nascent, Tencent and Alibaba are like the grandmothers of a rising Chinese Tech Dynasty.</p><p name="57eb" id="57eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The era of Tech monopoly consolidation means that the U.S. and China are both more or less pushing national endorsements that could give Baidu an advantage in working with car manufacturers and Tencent wider access to hospital data, Google and advantage in the Ad-Space and so forth. Rising Tech monopolies like Didi, means they can become something Uber could not with local challengers Lyft and Waymo at home. The National endorsed monopoly status, gives Chinese solutions an unfair advantage over their global competitors.</p><h4 name="639c" id="639c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Role of the Chinese Central Goverment in the AI Race</h4><p name="a9d1" id="a9d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Chinese government is beginning to play a larger role in funding AI ventures. Disbursing funds through “government guidance funds” (GGF) set up by local governments and state-owned companies, the government has invested more than USD 1 billion on domestic startups.</p><blockquote name="6d54" id="6d54" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Per a 2017 report, China has a higher percentage of AI companies that have received investments (69%) than the U.S. (51%).</blockquote><p name="6a39" id="6a39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Commercial sectors with significant state backing can progress more quickly. Additionally, the velocity of AI investment is relatively fast: from incorporation to receiving angel investment, the average time for Chinese companies is 9.73 months while it is 14.82 months for US companies. This means China is proving more agile in how it is fast-tracking the future of AI development. The speed up AI development in the 2020s in China is therefore relatively fast. This is in a field that is already moving more quickly than many experts in the field expected it to.</p><h4 name="82ec" id="82ec" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Where Democracy Fails Innovation</h4><p name="248e" id="248e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">China’s unique mode of public-private partnerships has many pros and cons, but certainly is more efficient than any model the U.S. has in place or could hope to implement. This is also because American cannot match the policy support, ample resources, and in some cases, a guaranteed minimum return for investors.</p><p name="5fc3" id="5fc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As China now possesses longevity of leadership, the plans it sets in motion as in investing in long-term, whole-of-society approaches to advancing AI technologies, cannot easily be replicated by a democratic system constantly adapting to new leadership and party influences.</p><p name="1d4c" id="1d4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">China must in the meantime remove any potential bottlenecks to its ability fast-track its AI development plan. China’s semiconductor industry itself is revealed to be a potential bottleneck for AI development. This is perhaps of the China’s major weaknesses histoically.</p><blockquote name="a717" id="a717" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">In the year 2015, China only had 4% of the global market share of semiconductor production, while the U.S. accounted for 50% of the global market share.</blockquote><p name="6599" id="6599" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Out of the top 10 American chip-makers, 4 specialize in making GPUs; whereas from the top 10 Chinese chip-making companies, none specialize in GPUs. In the second category of hardware, chips like TPUs and some ASICs are designed specifically to rapidly execute neural networks.109 Of the top 10 Chinese chip-makers, 6 specialize in ASIC chips, which are not as flexible as other chips in this category. We must not forget however, China’s ambition is testing its ability to evolve its AI development faster.</p><blockquote name="d23a" id="d23a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">China’s success in building supercomputers demonstrates its potential to catch-up to world leaders in AI hardware.</blockquote><p name="66ad" id="66ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">China has relied on imports and acquisitions to boost the most immediately relevant aspects of AI hardware, in the 2020s is must correct this given the high likelihood of trade wars. The Oxford University student points out that, China’s approach to building its domestic semiconductor industry is a microcosm for its overall approach to AI development.</p><h4 name="05c7" id="05c7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">China Leads with Critical Data Mass</h4><blockquote name="bf66" id="bf66" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--h4">Per a report by CCID Consulting, China is projected to possess 30% of the world’s data by 2030.</blockquote><p name="9fee" id="9fee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">The Chinese consumer being early and eager tech adopters with high mobile nativity means China’s data protectionism is fairly genius in the long-run. This is the most important segment of consumers in the world for rapid AI development.</p><p name="0bb2" id="0bb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Chinese government censored and blocked Facebook and Google, thereby enabling the rise of domestic platforms like Wechat and Weibo. In retrospect, this was the right thing to do.</p><p name="67bf" id="67bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If data is a scarce resource for AI development, China could establish exclusive control over this resource for its companies and research institutes.

It’s even highly probable that AI may be the first technology domain in which China successfully becomes the international standard setter. With transportation, a smart energy grid and other advances already set in motion, China can focus on its National brain and AI computing development.
