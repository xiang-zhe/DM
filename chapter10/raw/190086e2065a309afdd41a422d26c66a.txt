Easier access to birth control drives down abortion rates, the report also finds.</p><p>The report finds about 56 million abortions occur every year — nearly 50 million of them in developing countries. About a quarter of all pregnancies end in abortion.</p><p>Because there are so many women of childbearing age, the number of abortions has gone up, but the rates per 1,000 women have fallen, the report found.</p><p>Switzerland had the lowest abortion rate at 5 per 1,000 women. The U.S. rate is 13 per 1,000 women, the same as Britain's, the report found. Colombia and Mexico had abortion rates of 34 per 1,000 women. Pakistan’s estimated abortion rate was the highest at 50 per 1,000 women.</p><div class="Hu6r6bzzUDkhbCzEiWRZD ad-container"><div></div></div><p>"Abortions take place around the world, no matter the legal setting," the report reads.
