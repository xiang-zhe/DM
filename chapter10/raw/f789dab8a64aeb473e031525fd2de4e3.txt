Mr Kallen told Sky News he had been the victim of so many swatting attacks he now knows the officers at his local police station.This is the first time the gamers' grievances have spilled over to affect hundreds of schools.In a statement, VeltPvP said: \"We've been being harassed by a group of cybercriminals that are trying to harass us in any way possible.\"We're extremely sorry for anyone who had to deal with this, but just know it's fake.\"Asked if he felt remorse for Monday's scares in schools, one of the attackers said: \"Mentally, kind of, yes - that's human nature - but within the community, you have to become very thick skinned or you'll get exploited.\"He added: \"I'm not going to lose sleep over it.\"","wordCount":497,"genre":"technology","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"headline":"School bomb hoaxes revealed to be part of Minecraft gamer feud","description":"Exclusive: Smearing a rival's Minecraft server was the motive for 24,000 bomb hoax emails sent to schools in the UK.","dateline":"London,UK","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alexander J Martin, Technology Reporter"},"datePublished":"2018-03-19","dateModified":"2018-03-20","dateCreated":"2018-03-19","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/03\/750x563\/skynews-minecraft-game_4259579.jpg?20180319165135","width":750,"height":563},"url":"\/story\/school-bomb-hoaxes-revealed-to-be-part-of-minecraft-gamer-feud-11297062"}
