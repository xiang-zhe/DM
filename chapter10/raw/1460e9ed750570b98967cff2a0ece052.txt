      <p>On Sunday, March 18, Vladimir Putin was elected to rule Russia as president for a further six years. </p><p>But the date also marked the fourth anniversary of his annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, or as Russia describes it the "peaceful return" of the "historically Russian" region to the Russian Federation</p><p>On February 27, 2014, masked Russian troops without insignias took control of key government and strategic sites across the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, after months of bloody protests in Kiev's Maidan Square led to the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych's pro-Russian government. </p><p>A controversial independence referendum — widely regarded as illegitimate by the majority of the international community — was held on March 16. Crimea's predominantly ethnic Russian population voted to join Russia, and the Russian Federation claimed the peninsula two days later. </p><figure class="embed-content">

</figure><p> </p><p>The Crimean Tatars — a mainly Muslim Turkic ethnic group who settled on the Black Sea peninsula in the 10th century — were among the fiercest opponents of the Russian takeover.</p><p>Olga Skrypnyk, co-ordinator of the Kiev-based <a href="http://crimeahrg.org/en/review-on-the-human-rights-situation-in-crimea-in-january-2018/" target="_self" title="">Crimean Human Rights Group</a>, compiles a monthly summary of human rights violations by Russian authorities in Crimea. </p><p><a href="http://crimeahrg.org/en/review-on-the-human-rights-situation-in-crimea-in-january-2018/" target="_self" title="">Their reports</a> show any small protest against Russian authorities is punishable by hefty fines and imprisonment in overcrowded cells. Reports of police brutality and the denial of food and water are common. </p><p>In one case, a man posting "anti-Russian" comments on the internet was sentenced to two-and-a-half years prison for "incitement of hatred". In another, a Crimean Tatar was accused of making "a public appeal to action aimed at violating the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation" after writing "Crimea is Ukraine" on social media.</p><p>Even individuals holding "single-person pickets" in Crimean towns are fined for "participation in unauthorised public action".</p><p>Mr Kudusov's family remains in Crimea. Despite the difficulties, his relatives "don't want to leave their homes, jobs and most importantly, their homeland".</p><p>"There is constant discrimination against my people," said Mr Kudusov, who now runs an art gallery in Kiev.</p><p>"They only get work when there is no one else to take a job, our language is no longer taught in schools, and state institutions and courts no longer accept documents in our language. And all around us the Russian population is being set against us."</p><h2>Pressure over vote</h2><p>Less than 1 per cent of Crimea's 250,000 strong Crimean Tatar population voted in the 2014 independence referendum.</p><figure class="embed-content">

</figure><p> </p><p>Mr Kudusov said none of his extended family — some 400 to 500 people — intended to vote in the 2018 presidential election.</p><p>He described multiple instances of Crimean Tatars being threatened with dismissal from their jobs if they didn't vote, in particular "doctors, university lecturers and teachers who work in the government or municipal systems".</p><p>"[Federal Security Service] agents are putting extreme pressure on Crimean Tatars and intimidating them to force them to vote," said Ayder Muzhdabaev, deputy general director of the Crimean-language TV channel ATR.</p><p>"The authorities need images for television to demonstrate that Crimean Tatars support them, when in actual fact they don't want to vote in the elections of the occupying authorities."</p><h2>A turbulent history</h2><p>Relations between the Crimean Tatars and Russia have always been turbulent. </p><p>Empress Catherine the Great annexed the strategically important peninsula from the Ottomans into the Russian Empire in 1783. </p><p>A century and a half later, the entire population of 190,000 Crimean Tatars was deported to Uzbekistan on the orders of Joseph Stalin. Accused of collaborating with the Nazis, more than 40 per cent died en route or during their exile. </p><p>Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians moved into Soviet Crimea, including a large contingent of military, KGB officers and their families. The temperate climate and exotic palms also made Crimea a sought-after holiday destination for the Soviet elite.</p><figure class="embed-content">

Official Russian statistics, however, give the figure as 40,000.</p><p>"We will never know how many people moved from Russia, because Russian figures don't count military officers, [Federal Security Service] agents, tax inspectors or their families," Mr Muzhdabaev said. </p><figure class="embed-content">

There will be more pressure on business owners — more checks by the tax police, fire inspectors, secret services and others," he said. "The Russian authorities don't want disloyal people, and 99 per cent of Crimean Tatars are disloyal to the occupiers."</p><p>Ethnic Ukrainians in Crimea are also marginalised.
