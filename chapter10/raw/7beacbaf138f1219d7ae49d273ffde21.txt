Ms Wall's torso was found with more than 38 stab wounds and lesions.On Wednesday, Madsen claimed he slashed her body to prevent the build-up of gases that occurs when a person dies.The examiner contradicted Madsen's statement, saying the stab lesions were \"superficial\" and as a result \"serve no purpose of letting gasses leave or enter.\"Giving evidence on other wounds inflicted on Ms Wall, the examiner said lesions inside Ms Wall's genitals \"could\" have been inflicted while she was dying, but the 15 punctures above her genitals were most likely inflicted after her death.The prosecution have painted a picture of Madsen as a sexual sadist who was obsessed with beheadings and murdered Ms Wall as part of a sexual fantasy.On the second day of the trial, jurors were shown animated videos from Madsen's hard drive which showed women being decapitated and impaled. The examiner also told the court the victim's head may have been restrained or gagged and that her hands and feet could have been tied.Ms Wall's torso showed evidence of blunt force being inflicted while she was still alive, she added.\"This typically happens if you run into a table or is hit by a hand or another body part,\" the medical examiner told the court.A witness who helped rescue Madsen from the sinking submarine told the court on Thursday that the accused seemed \"calm and focused and not as shaken, other than [a] small shiver\".Ms Wall's boyfriend added about his late girlfriend: \"She was at the same time an incredibly ambitious journalist and an amazingly curious person, who found beauty in all places and couldn't stop herself from travelling, experiencing, discovering and sharing with others.\" Madsen has admitted lying to investigators and changing his account of what actually happened to Ms Wall several times.The prosecution has said it will seek a life sentence, which in Denmark averages around 16 years, or safe custody, a legal alternative which would keep him behind bars indefinitely as long as he is deemed dangerous.Six out of 37 experts and witnesses have been heard so far in the trial, which continues on Friday.","wordCount":637,"genre":"world","publisher":{"@id":"#Publisher"},"headline":"Kim Wall's boyfriend: Journalist was afraid of the submarine where she died","description":"Peter Madsen denies torturing and killing Ms Wall as graphic evidence of wounds inflicted on the victim's body is heard in court.","dateline":"London,UK","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Julie Astrid Thomsen, News Reporter, in Denmark"},"datePublished":"2018-03-22","dateModified":"2018-03-22","dateCreated":"2018-03-22","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/18\/03\/750x563\/skynews-kim-wall-peter-madsen_4261925.jpg?20180322151548","width":750,"height":563},"url":"\/story\/kim-walls-boyfriend-journalist-was-afraid-of-the-submarine-where-she-died-11300285"}
